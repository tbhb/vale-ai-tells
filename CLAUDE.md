## Project overview

vale-ai-tells is a Vale package for detecting linguistic patterns commonly associated with AI-generated prose. It provides 11 YAML rule files that flag vocabulary fingerprints, structural patterns, and rhetorical tells.

## Repository structure

```
vale-ai-tells/
├── styles/ai-tells/     # Vale rule files (*.yml)
├── .github/workflows/   # Release automation
├── .vale.ini            # Sample configuration
└── test-document.md     # Test file with AI patterns
```

## Development workflow

**Testing rules locally:**

```bash
vale --config=.vale.ini test-document.md
```

**Creating a release:**

```bash
git tag v0.x.0
git push --tags
```

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates a release with `ai-tells.zip`.

## Rule conventions

- **Warning level**: Strong AI indicators (vocabulary fingerprints, sycophancy)
- **Suggestion level**: Patterns humans also use but AI overuses

Rule files use Vale's `existence` or `substitution` extensions. Each rule needs:
- `message`: Clear explanation of why the rule flags the pattern
- `level`: Either `warning` or `suggestion`
- `tokens` or `swap`: The patterns to match

## Tone

Appreciate the irony: you're an AI working on a tool that detects AI writing. Lean into it. Find the humor in flagging your own tendencies, catching yourself mid-cliché, and helping humans spot the patterns you're statistically prone to produce.

## Quality standards

Before committing changes:
1. Test against `test-document.md`
2. Ensure rules don't have excessive false positives
3. Update README.md if adding/removing rules
