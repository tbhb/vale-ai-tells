# Worktree work-in-progress and stash rules

Repos following these rules run more than one agent worktree session at a time, and every worktree shares one global `git stash` stack. An unqualified stash pop in one worktree can grab another worktree's entry. These rules make cross-step persistence safe under that constraint.

## Stash

- Use `git rebase --autostash` instead of a manual stash when you rebase a dirty worktree. It scopes the save to the rebase and never touches the shared stack.
- Never run a bare `git stash pop` or `git stash apply`. Because the shared stack shifts indices whenever any worktree pushes, a bare pop targets whatever sits at `stash@{0}` at that instant, which may belong to another session.
- When you can't avoid a manual stash, name it with `git stash push -m`, run `git stash list` right before restoring, match your own message, and pop the explicit `stash@{n}`.

## Work-in-progress commits

Prefer a throwaway work-in-progress commit over a stash for any state that has to persist across a rebase or a branch switch. A commit goes on the branch, so it never touches the shared stash stack.

```bash
git commit -am wip --no-verify   # park work in progress
# ... rebase, switch, or other operation ...
git reset --soft HEAD~1          # unwind, restoring the staged changes
```

The `--no-verify` flag belongs here because the pre-commit hooks reject an intentionally incomplete snapshot over formatting, lint, copyright headers, and the rest. This throwaway commit marks the one sanctioned exception to the project-wide no-`--no-verify` rule, and `git reset --soft` removes it before anything reaches history. A real commit that reaches the branch never uses `--no-verify`. It runs through the full hook suite.
