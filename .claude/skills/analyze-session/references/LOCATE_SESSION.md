# Locating a session

Use this when the operator identified a session without giving a usable path. Searching the projects directory in the calling session costs more context than the analysis that follows, so a cheap agent does it and returns one line.

Haiku is enough. Matching a file by its contents doesn't need judgment, and the answer is one path.

## The template

Fill in the search string, then spawn one agent:

```text
Agent({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Locate a session transcript",
  prompt: `Find one Claude Code transcript and return its absolute path.

  Run this, where <SKILL> is the analyze-session skill directory:

    <SKILL>/scripts/session.py locate --contains '<SEARCH STRING>'

  It prints size, path, and match count per candidate, newest first.

  Try these in order until one matches, and report which one worked:
    1. --contains '<SEARCH STRING>'
    2. --contains '<SECOND SEARCH STRING>'
    3. --project '<REPO NAME>' with no --contains, listing every
       transcript for that project so the caller picks by size and date

  Return the absolute path alone when exactly one candidate matches.
  Return every candidate with its size and match count when more than
  one does. Say so plainly when nothing matches.

  NEVER read a transcript. Each one is megabytes and would exceed your
  context. The locate subcommand reads them line by line without
  holding them in memory, which is why you run it instead of opening
  files yourself.`,
})
```

## Choosing a search string

Pick a string appearing in that session and in no other. A filename the session created works well, and so does an identifier it invented or a rule name from its own output.

Avoid anything the repository already contains. A common word matches every transcript mentioning the project, and the agent returns a list rather than an answer.

## What to do with a null result

Zero hits proves nothing until the same string matches something else. A search matching no transcript may mean the session is absent, or may mean the string was wrong.

Give the agent a second string to try before concluding the session doesn't exist.

## A common mistake

A session running inside a git worktree writes its transcript under the main repository's project directory. The worktree's own directory under `~/.claude/projects/` may exist without containing any `.jsonl` at all.

Guessing the path from the working directory finds an empty directory, which looks the same as a missing transcript. Searching by content answers it correctly.
