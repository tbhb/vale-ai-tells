# guard-merge — PreToolUse gate on Bash, scoped to the merge-pr skill.
#
# squash-merge.sh holds the gates that keep a message nothing reviewed
# or linted off the default branch. A direct gh call skips all of them,
# and the result is permanent, because nothing lints a squash commit
# after the fact.
#
# The rule is an allowlist rather than a list of refusals. Reading is
# open, and everything that changes a pull request goes through the
# script. Naming the read-only verbs rather than the mutating ones means
# a verb gh grows later arrives already covered.
#
# Scope note. A skill's hooks outlive the turn that invoked it, so this
# guard is still live while pr, watch-pr, and fix-pr run. It governs
# `gh pr` alone, and its allowlist matches the pr skill's, so the two
# agree wherever both are active.
#
# Exit 2 blocks and hands stderr back as the reason. Verified against
# Claude Code 2.1.220: a skill-frontmatter PreToolUse hook receives the
# Bash payload with the command at .tool_input.command, and exit 2 does
# block the call.

# `gh stack merge` is a different top-level command, so the gh pr rule

# it merges every member of the stack at once and accepts no --subject
# and no --body. That is one GitHub-generated squash message per member,
# none of them linted, all of them permanent.

concatenation of a branch's commits, once per member, and nothing lints a
squash commit afterwards.

A stack merges bottom-up, one member at a time, through the
merge-pr-stack skill. Each member then merges here, under a message
review-squash-message cleared and the commit-msg gates passed."

deny "\`gh pr ${verb}\` changes the pull request, and merging runs through one
entry point:

  bash .claude/skills/merge-pr/scripts/squash-merge.sh <number>

That script checks that the message names this pull request, that
review-squash-message cleared the exact bytes on disk, that the message
passes the commit-msg gates, and that the pull request is open, ready,
and green. It then merges, removes the drafts, and deletes the branch.

Calling gh directly writes a message onto the default branch that
nothing reviewed, and nothing lints a squash commit afterwards.

Reading stays open: gh pr list, view, diff, status, and checks all run
without asking."
