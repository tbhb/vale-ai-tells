Do not open rollout files to search them. Reading transcripts to find
one costs more context than the analysis that follows.

Dispatch a delegated agent to locate it, following the template in
$skill/references/LOCATE_SESSION.md. Give it the fingerprint the operator
described: a filename the session created, an identifier, or a rule name
out of its output.

Then run this preflight again with the path it returns:

  bash $here/preflight.sh <path>

Codex stores rollouts under date directories in ~/.codex/sessions. Do not
infer a rollout path from the repository or worktree path.
