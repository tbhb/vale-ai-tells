# Resolve rebase conflicts

Settle every conflicted path and stage it, so the rebase can advance. This skill ends there. Continuing the replay and verifying the result belong to the `rebase` skill.

A guard hook runs alongside. It refuses `--ours` and `--theirs`, which mean the opposite of what they read during a rebase, and it refuses staging a file with markers still in it.

## The inversion, once

During a rebase git checks out the base and replays your commits onto it. Your work is the side arriving, so git calls it `--theirs`, and the base you are moving onto becomes `--ours`. Every intuition about which word means which runs backwards here, and a wrong pick resolves cleanly and stays wrong.

This skill avoids both words. The sides are:

- `base-side` is the commit the branch replays onto. git calls it `--ours`, and the index calls it stage 2.
- `replayed-side` is the commit git is replaying right now. git calls it `--theirs`, and the index calls it stage 3.

Because the scripts read the index stages rather than the marker labels, the naming is correct under whatever marker style the repository sets.

## Marker shape

With `merge.conflictStyle` set to `diff3` or `zdiff3`, a conflict has three sections rather than two:

<!-- rumdl-disable merge-conflict -->

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
the base-side content
||||||| <ancestor label>
what both sides started from
=======
the replayed-side content
>>>>>>> <commit> (<subject>)
```

<!-- rumdl-enable merge-conflict -->

That `|||||||` section is the common ancestor, and it's the most useful part of the block: it says what each side changed rather than only what each side now contains. The default `merge` style omits it. Handle both, and never assume the two-way form.

A bare `=======` line isn't a marker on its own. Because it underlines a setext heading in ordinary Markdown, the scripts here match only `<<<<<<<`, `|||||||`, and `>>>>>>>`.

## Step 0: the checklist

Track these steps with the session's task-list tools where the harness provides them. Newer harnesses leave those tools out by default, and a session without them works the list in order as written.

1. Classify every conflicted path
2. Resolve the mechanical ones
3. Take a whole side where that's the answer
4. Read the rest, and stage what you resolved
5. Hand back

Where a class turns out empty, mark its step done and say so rather than dropping it. Which classes the stop produced is part of the report at the end.

The scripts stop with a plain message when no rebase is in progress. Say that and hand back, because nothing here applies outside one.

## Step 1: classify before editing anything

```text
bash .claude/skills/resolve-rebase-conflicts/scripts/classify-conflicts.sh
```

One call reads every unmerged path and says what shape its conflict has, with the evidence for the claim printed beside it. Read that output before opening any file.

The classes:

| Class | What it means | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sorted-union` | All three versions sorted and unique, and neither side removed a line | `resolve-union.sh`, no confirmation |
| `regenerate` | The repository declares the path generated | `take-side.sh <path> base-side`, then run the generator after the rebase |
| `token-union` | Both sides extended the same line with extra tokens | Apply the printed proposal once the operator confirms the ordering |
| `content` | A real disagreement | Read what each side changed, then resolve by hand |

For a content conflict the script also prints what each side changed against the common ancestor. The markers can't show you that, and it's what settles the resolution.

## Step 2: resolve the mechanical ones

```text
bash .claude/skills/resolve-rebase-conflicts/scripts/resolve-union.sh <path> [path ...]
```

An append-only sorted list conflicts on nearly every rebase, and the answer comes out the same every time: every line either side has, sorted, once each. A word list, a spelling dictionary, a vocabulary file. Asking an operator to confirm that means asking them to rubber-stamp arithmetic.

Safety comes from the condition rather than the filename. The script refuses unless all three versions really do sort cleanly under the C collation with no duplicate line, and unless both sides kept every line the ancestor had. Those two conditions are what make a union provably lossless. A file that stops meeting them stops resolving here, which is what keeps a name-based shortcut from applying after the property it assumed stops being true.

After writing, the script re-derives the union from the index stages and compares the two. The result must contain exactly the lines the two sides contain between them. No duplicates, and still sorted. A resolution that dropped a line fails there rather than in a lint run three commits later.

Don't confirm any of this with the operator. Report it in the summary at the end.

## Step 3: take a whole side where that's the answer

```text
bash .claude/skills/resolve-rebase-conflicts/scripts/take-side.sh <path> base-side
bash .claude/skills/resolve-rebase-conflicts/scripts/take-side.sh <path> replayed-side
```

A generated file is the clear case. Merging two versions of machine output means nothing, because the generator is about to overwrite both. Take either side and move on. The `rebase` skill's verification names the path again at the end, so you don't forget the regeneration.

A `delete/modify` conflict is the other case, and it isn't mechanical. One side removed the file and the other edited it. Deciding needs the intent behind the removal. Find it, say what you found, then take a side.

## Step 4: read the rest

For a `content` conflict, work from what each side was trying to do rather than from the marker block. The classifier already printed both diffs against the common ancestor. Where you need more:

```text
git diff :1:<path> :2:<path>    # what the base-side changed
git diff :1:<path> :3:<path>    # what the replayed-side changed
```

Resolve so that the result keeps both intents. Keeping one side's edit and quietly dropping the other is the failure to watch for, and afterwards it looks identical to a clean resolution. Nothing you can run at this point tells the two apart. For that reason the `rebase` skill range-diffs the whole branch at the end rather than trusting that the replay applied.

One thing in a `token-union` proposal needs the operator: the ordering. Nobody disputes the union of the additions, but where those new tokens belong in the line is a judgement about how the file reads. Print the proposal, ask, apply the answer.

Stage what you resolved, by name:

```text
git add -- path/one path/two
```

Never `git add -A` or `git add .`. During a rebase those sweep in whatever an earlier commit in the replay left behind. The guard refuses both, along with any file with markers still in it.

## Step 5: hand back

Say what each path was and how you resolved it. Name anything you took a whole side on, and anything a generator still has to rewrite.

Then return to the `rebase` skill, which continues the replay through `continue-rebase.sh`. That script reads the staged blobs for markers once more before it advances.

Where a stop looks like the branch came off the wrong base entirely, say so instead of grinding through the rest. `git rebase --abort` doesn't cost anything.

## A note on rerere

Where `rerere.enabled` is on, git replays resolutions it recorded during earlier rebases and stages them without stopping. git never reports those paths as conflicts, so nothing here classifies them and nothing has read them since the recording. `rebase-status.sh` lists them under `staged without stopping`. Read any that the stopped commit also touches. A resolution git recorded against different surrounding code can apply cleanly and still mean something else now.

## Preconditions

- a rebase in progress under the merge backend, which is git's default
- `python3` on the path, which the classifier and the union resolver both use

The scripts check both and stop with a plain message when either is missing.
