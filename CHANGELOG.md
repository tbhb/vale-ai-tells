### Added

- **FigurativeShape** (`ai-tells`): New rule. "Shape" as a stand-in for whichever concrete noun the writer skipped: a data structure, a message format, a review's size, a regular expression, a prose rhythm ("fires on the shape rather than the provenance," "those two numbers pick the review shape," "the rules that shape an analysis," "calls of the same shape," "the wrong shape," "code-shaped"). A documentation-corpus census ranked it the most frequent figurative noun with no rule reading it, and this package's own rule comments and README rows used the word the same way for every token pattern, so the sweep that landed the rule reworded those too. A determiner-gated noun with an optional modifier, the bare "shape of," the verb in its gerund and relative forms ("shaping the direction of the API," "what shapes the output"), the hyphenated compound past the geometry prefixes, and the gated plural; the sculptor with a determined subject ("the pass shapes the output") stays with `MotionMetaphors`, the modifier slot refuses the Go compiler's "GC shape" and the turtle module's drawn shape, and the trailing check refuses the generics vocabulary ("shape type," "shape instantiation") and the geometric heads ("the shape of the curve"). The cost is real and flagged on the maintainer's call: about sixty-five hits across the seven pre-LLM corpora, most of them the figure in argument prose ("the particular shape of the parse trees," "the shape of the portable SIMD API") plus the array-dimension term the typing PEPs use ("generic in its shape"), which no trailing check separates from the figure.
- **FusionMetaphors** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Merging described as matter joining: a change that "folds" a helper "into" the caller, rules that "collapse into" one, a token that "absorbs" a sibling, a fix that "fuses" two paths, a flag that "couples" the cache "to" the writer. The plain verbs are merged, combined, added, and joined, with both things named. Every token gates on the verb plus a determined object or destination, so "a fold," "the collapse," and "tight coupling" stay out; the family measures nine across the seven pre-LLM corpora, each the figure. Disable the rule for physics or chemistry prose.
- **DepletionMetaphors** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Failure and slowdown described as a body or an engine giving out: a loop that "exhausts its budget," a retry that "starves" the writer "of" slots, a job that "stalls on" a lock, a query that "degrades on" large inputs. The plain sentence says what ran out, what waited, and on which limit. Each token gates on the complement that makes the verb figurative and measures zero across the seven pre-LLM corpora. Disable the rule for prose about engines or nutrition.
- **AnthropomorphicAdjectives** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Character grades applied to a mechanism: a default that is "benign," a test that is "brittle," a heap target that is "noisy," a timeout that is "generous," a cache that "stays healthy," a claim that is "honest about its limits." `AnthropomorphicJustification` reads the merit verbs and nothing read the adjectives, which a documentation-corpus census found to be a class of their own. An attributive token gated on a determiner, refusing the heads that take the adjective literally (a person, a tumor, a tip, a room), and a predicative token gated on a copula, with "honest" only there since `EnforcementMetaphors` reads the honest count. The census offered sixteen adjectives and the rest measured out: "naive," "aggressive," "conservative," "expensive," "fragile," "greedy," "smart," "graceful," "elegant," and "happy" are the corpora's own vocabulary or belong to other rules. The six kept match fourteen times across the seven pre-LLM corpora ("generous upper limit," "noisy heap target," "brittle workarounds," "benign snippet"), each the figure. Disable the rule for medical or community prose.

### Changed

- **Installation**: The README snippet now installs `ai-tells` by name. Vale's package catalog lists the style, so `Packages = ai-tells` reaches the latest release without a version in the line. A release URL still pins a version, and `ai-tells-commits` keeps one because the catalog does not list it; Vale syncs a list that mixes the two forms.
- **FigurativeSurfaces** (`ai-tells`): The bare verb behind a modal, an infinitive marker, or a negation now fires ("tooling to surface changes," "will surface reports," "can surface bugs," "doesn't surface the failure"). A documentation-corpus census found the uninflected form escaping, since every token read an inflected one. Thirteen hits across the seven pre-LLM corpora, each the figure.
- **FigurativeNouns** (`ai-tells`): "Surface" as what a reader or a caller sees joins the noun list ("the prose surface," "its canonical surface," "a reader-facing surface," "the whole surface"), the census's second-ranked figurative noun with no rule reading it. The modifier slot refuses the exported-names term ("the API surface," "the attack surface," "its public surface") and the lookahead the physical and linguistic compounds ("surface area," "surface syntax," "the surface language," "the surface of the moon"); it fires seven times in the Rust RFCs and PEPs, five making the same figure and two on the bare "on the surface."
- **FigurativeReaches** (`ai-tells`): The imperative ("Reach for it in a script," "Reach for a slice when the skip doesn't cover it") and the second-person or generic-human subject ("you might reach for a git dependency," "users reach for the path form," "one reaches for the same helper") now fire. A documentation-corpus census counted the imperative as the form agent prose uses most, with nothing in the rule reading it. The sentence or list-item start gates the imperative, which measures zero across the seven pre-LLM corpora; the human-subject token reverses the rule's earlier ruling that left the bare human idiom alone, and fires five times, four Rust RFCs and one Go comment making the same selection figure. "People" and "person" left the exceptions for the same reason; a hand, a child, a climber, and a robot still reach literally and stay excepted.
- **MotionMetaphors**, **EnforcementMetaphors**, **FigurativeQuiet**, **FigurativeRides**, **JourneyMetaphors**, and **FigurativeIdioms** (`ai-tells`): The one-token verbs a documentation-corpus census found no rule reading. `MotionMetaphors` takes the seated passenger and the lagging runner ("the loader seats the record in the cache," "the mirror trails the newest release"); `EnforcementMetaphors` the setting in office and the failure climbing the chain of command ("the flag governs whether the cache writes," "a warning escalates to an error"); `FigurativeQuiet` the muting verb ("the flag silences the warning"); `FigurativeRides` the chain as a ridden mechanism ("the lookup rides the chain"); `JourneyMetaphors` the counted stretch and the tier vocabulary ("walks three tiers," "walks each level of precedence"); and `FigurativeIdioms` burial ("buried in the config," "buries the error"). Governs costs four pre-LLM corpus hits, escalates five, burial five, silences nine (the Rust RFCs and Python sources writing "silence the lint" and "silence this exception"), and the rest zero.
- **FigurativeNouns** (`ai-tells`): The census's remaining figurative nouns join the list: "grain" as granularity ("one grain of the analysis," "at a coarser grain"), "lens" as a point of view ("through a security lens"), "headline" as the quoted number ("the headline number"), "cascade" as a chain of consequences ("a cascade of retries"), the spatial pair "dead end" and "blind spot," and "seam" as a join between components ("the injection seam"). Each gates on a determiner or a compound and refuses the physical senses ("a grain of sand," "the lens cap," "seam allowance"). Grain costs seven pre-LLM corpus hits, the Rust RFCs arguing error recovery "at a coarse grain" and a PEP offering "finer grain control," each the figure; the rest cost one or two apiece or none. "Strata" stays out as the statistics term for a sampling layer, and "pre-flight" and "heartbeat" stay out as terms of art.

### Fixed

- **EmphaticCopula** (`ai-tells`): Bold markup no longer fires the rule. Every asterisk token was a bare regular expression, and a doubled-asterisk span contains the same shape a single-asterisk one does once the outer pair is counted in, so a sentence carrying bold and no italics at all raised an alert whose message asked for italics to be removed. Each asterisk token now requires an unpaired asterisk on either side, which leaves single-asterisk emphasis as the only match and drops the bold-italic triple along with bold. The underscore tokens are unchanged, because a doubled-underscore run never contains the space-prefixed shape they require. A bold-markup case in `test-false-positives.md` covers the regression.

## [1.33.0] - 2026-09-06

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **CoordinatedReveal** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The reveal by quantifier: a claim stated once in compressed form, then ", and", then the same claim again with a totality word doing the turn. "For search that join reverses, and a chunk that ranks well maps back to every blob that contains it," "content-addressed and append-only, and a blob's bytes never change once captured," "and only the sweeper," "and nothing else has it," and the universal with the anaphoric relative delivered as its own sentence ("each caller that reads them"). It is the "not X, it's Y" formula with the negation deleted, the same two-beat pivot with "and" doing the work of "but" or a colon, and it surfaced once `ContrastiveFormulas` and `ContrastiveNegation` caught the spelled-out versions. Vale cannot see a restatement, so the tokens take the reveal clause; the five shapes cost nine hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself.
- **ConsequenceParticiple** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The consequence participle tail, "which means" with the "which means" deleted: a clause ends, then a comma and a present participle restate its effect. "The sweeper drops the row, leaving the cache cold," "rebuilds the index on every write, making every read a miss," "giving the caller one row per blob," "meaning the index is stale," "letting the reader skip the scan," "forcing a second pass," "saving a round-trip," "costing one extra read," "turning every lookup into a scan," and the prepositional spellings "resulting in," "leading to," and "ending up with," which no other rule named. `ParticipialPadding` catches the press-release lexicon and never saw this plainer register. The gate is the participle plus a determiner, pronoun, or quantifier, so "making sure," "leaving aside," "giving up," and "meaning of" stay quiet, and "making a best effort" and "making it possible" are measured out; the kept participles cost about a hundred hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself, while "allowing," "causing," and "creating" stay out as the ordinary docs spelling of a side effect.
- **ShellNounCopula** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The shell noun and its copula: an abstract noun, "is" or "was," and a that-clause that carries the whole claim. "The problem is that the index goes stale," "The difference was that the second build read the cache," "One catch is that the daemon keeps the lock," "The question is whether a restart clears the cache," "The only reason is that the flag defaults to off," and the "here" spelling ("The real issue here is that the socket closes early"). It is `LabelAndExplain`'s colon written out as a copula, and it surfaced on the pages that had already lost their colons. The noun list is curated to the shells, so "the rule is that" and "the invariant is that" stay out as the definitions human docs write; the kept shapes cost about eighty hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself.
- **SummativeAppositive** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The summative appositive: a finished clause, a comma, and an abstraction noun that names what the clause just was, with a relative clause hung off it. "Rebuilt on every read, a cost that shows up in the benchmarks," "sees one row, a distinction the old path never made," "drops the header, something no caller expects," "a detail worth noting," "which is exactly the point." The sentence had ended; the appositive reopens it to grade the claim and repeat it, the padding beat's "and that matters because" turn delivered without any of the words that used to mark it, and the sibling of `CoordinatedReveal`, where the same restatement rides on ", and". The label nouns are the evaluative abstractions agent prose reaches for, so an ordinary appositive naming a thing stays quiet, and "which is what" and "which is why" stay out as the human afterthought at forty corpus hits; the kept shapes cost two across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself.
- **AbstractionSubject** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The anaphoric abstraction subject: the prior sentence compressed into an abstract noun with a demonstrative on it, and that noun made the subject of a comment. "That asymmetry is the point," "This inversion buys the reverse lookup," "That gap is where the second read happens," "This separation is deliberate," "That symmetry is not an accident," "This coupling is the price," and the plural "These asymmetries are the whole reason the cache exists." The plain form names the thing and says what it does. `Metacommentary` already took "This X matters." and "This X means," and `MicDrop` took "This is the point," so this rule covers the abstraction noun ahead of the copula and ahead of any other verb of comment, over a measured list of fifty nouns. A passive after the copula stays quiet as docs English ("is enforced by the database"), a measurement stays quiet ("is 4 bytes"), and lowercase "that" never fires; the kept shapes cost three hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself.
- **StrawmanContrast** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The strawman contrast tail: the "not X" half of the "not X, it's Y" formula moved to the end of the clause, refuting an alternative nobody proposed. "The reader walks the index, rather than walking the whole tree," "it reads the offsets directly, instead of re-reading each file," "the join goes from chunk to blob, not the other way around," "the lookup is one read, rather than a scan," "it keeps one copy, not one per caller." `ContrastiveFormulas` and `ContrastiveNegation` catch the spelled-out and telegraphic versions, and this is where the contrast went once they did. "Rather than" and "instead of" are ordinary English at about 1,750 hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, and the comma alone still costs 150, so the gates are the comma and the shape after it held to the end of the sentence: a gerund ("rather than walking") or a determiner and its noun phrase ("rather than a scan"), plus the reversal, per-unit, and totality tails behind ", not". The kept shapes cost about thirty corpus hits, each the construction itself in human hands, and the gerund tail is the loudest token in the family.
- **ScopePartition** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The scope partition, the setup that makes a reveal possible: the writer splits the world in two and fronts each half with a comma-fenced label. "On the read side, the lookup is one hop. On the write side, every blob is hashed," "Read-side, the join is one hop," "At index time, the tokenizer runs once. At query time, it runs again," and the coordinator-gated lowercase spellings ("and on the write side,"). It is the two-beat pivot `CoordinatedReveal` and `ContrastiveFormulas` catch, delivered as stage directions rather than a contrast word, so it survived when the contrast words were suppressed. The comma is the gate: "on the right-hand side of," "at link time, before we," and "at run time" without the fronting comma are ordinary technical English and stay out; the kept shapes cost eight hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself. `StackedAnaphora` gains the paired "For X, ... For Y," opener across two consecutive sentences ("For search, that join reverses. For writes, the table takes one append"), with the discourse markers ("For example," "For now,") excluded; one corpus hit, the fmt docs.
- **PseudoCleft** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The pseudo-cleft: a free relative as subject, a copula, then a claim short enough to have stood alone. "What changed is the direction," "What you get is one row per blob," "What remains is the offset," "All you need is the offset," "All that's required is a token," "The only thing that changes is the direction," "Where this pays off is the read path," and the bare-verb spelling "all it does is call the hook." It is the "Here's what" lead of `ExplainerLeads` with the demonstrative dropped, and it surfaced once the announcing spellings were suppressed. `ExplainerLeads` keeps the determiner-fronted form, `RestatementMarkers` "What this means is," and `ColloquialAssessments` the "matters" verdicts, so the tokens here take the pronoun and bare-verb subjects, the "all" and "the only" frames, and "Where" with a payoff verb; a question mark in the sentence and a determiner gate after the copula keep questions and predicate adjectives out. The six shapes cost about twenty-eight hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself.

### Changed

- **RestatementMarkers** (`ai-tells`): Now catches the restatement after its formal openers were suppressed: the parallel restatement ("The same holds for writes," "The same is true of the index," "The same applies to the reader," "The same goes for every caller"), the framing opener that promises a practical or net reading and then repeats the claim ("In practice, the index is one file"; "In effect, the join reverses"; "In the end, one read"), the gloss openers "Put another way" and "which is to say," and the sentence-initial "Meaning" gloss ("Meaning, the cache is cold" and the fragment "Meaning the cache is cold"). The framing openers gate on the capital and the comma, because mid-sentence "in practice" and "in effect" are ordinary docs English; the kept shapes cost about fifty hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, each the construction itself. "That is," measures out at a hundred and sixty sentence-initial hits as the Go doc-comment house gloss, and "Likewise" and "That is to say" stay in `FormalTransitions`. The message gained a second action for the parallel case: name both cases in the sentence that makes the point.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **NegatedPair** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The coordinated negated pair, a fact stated by naming two absences: "with no database and no network," "needs neither the database nor a round-trip," "runs without a database or a round-trip," "doesn't need credentials and doesn't call the network," the "nor" continuation ("nor does it call the network"), the sentence-initial pair with its own verb ("Neither the database nor the network is required"), and the asyndetic badge copy ("no setup, no config, no fuss"). A documentation-corpus audit of 171 files named it the construction reviewers push back on most, and the prepositional spellings had no verb for `NegatedObject` to gate on. The determiner gates "without a X or a Y," because bare "without X or Y" is docs English eighty times over in the Go and Python standard libraries, and "has neither" stays out with "has no"; the kept shapes cost about thirty corpus hits, a third of them one repeated Go license comment.
- **BareHolds** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The bare possession verb, a data structure with hands: "the table holds every stage's tables," "two records hold identical bytes," "whatever the store holds," "the counts the aux tables already hold," "code held as a config value," "a directory holding one." The same audit counted 133 of these, the highest-frequency violation in its corpus and the one that drew the strongest reviewer objection; `FigurativeHolds` gates on the idiom complement and never saw the container sense. An open determiner-gated subject with the object inside the span, so the exceptions can name the concurrency register (a goroutine holds the lock, a caller holds a reference) and the physical world (a hand, a jar, a clamp). Split from `FigurativeHolds` because the cost is large: about 160 hits across the standard libraries, the container idiom of pre-LLM programming prose, flagged on the maintainer's call and documented as the loudest rule in the package on ordinary technical writing. A project that keeps the container sense disables it per file.
- **BareReaches** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The bare arrival verb with an inanimate subject: "only referenced records reach the store," "an orphan never reaches an extractor," "the stage hasn't reached that record yet," "a fragment reaches nothing," "the items a query reaches." The audit counted 180 of these; `FigurativeReaches` takes only the selection sense ("reaches for"). An open determiner-gated subject with a bare plural, the perfect tenses, and the clause-final relative clause as companions; beings, vehicles, and the physics register sit in the exceptions, and the measurement senses ("reaches zero," "reaches EOF," "reaches its limit," "the timeout is reached") stay quiet. Split from `FigurativeReaches` so the selection tokens keep their zero corpus cost while this one carries about fifty hits, the transport idiom of runtime prose.
- **MortalityMetaphors** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Life, death, and survival handed to a process or a row: a run that "dies part way through," a process that "can die mid-write," a row that "survives unchanged," a file that "survives the rebase untouched" (moved here from `FigurativeIdioms`), a cache entry that "outlives" the request, a record kept "for its whole life." An open determiner-gated subject with the beings, plants, batteries, and bulbs that literally die in the exceptions; threads and processes are not excepted, so the runtime register ("if the parent dies," about twenty corpus hits) and the compiler's "outlives" (nineteen, all escape analysis) fire on the maintainer's call. "Dead values" and "dead code" stay out as compiler vocabulary.
- **MotionMetaphors** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Motion and force verbs applied to data or control flow: a pipeline that "feeds" a stage, a row that "strands," rows that "swamp" an index, a table that "dwarfs" the rest, a stage that "crowds out" the rest, a planner that "leans on" an index, a step that "mints" an identifier, a default "baked in," a config that "drives" the build, a pass that "shapes" the output, "cracks open," "sheds." Each verb gates on the shape the audit saw, at zero to two corpus hits apiece; "comes from," "arrives," "routes," "flows," "brings," "seeds," "fuses," and the sponge register's "squeezes" and "absorbs" measured out.
- **FigurativeNouns** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Nominalized figuration, which every verb-anchored rule misses: "reach" as a retrieval path ("its primary reach," "per-rule reach," "picks between two reaches"), "wrinkle" as a complication, "story" as a design ("the migration story"), and "knob" as an option. Each gates on the determiner or compound that makes the noun figurative, at zero to two corpus hits apiece; "heartbeat," "waterfall," and "gap" stay out as terms of art or too ordinary to gate.
- **FigurativeKeeps** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The upkeep frame: "keeps a re-run cheap," "keeps search fast," "keeps the index small," "keeps an orphan away from every extractor," "keeps the rest clear of it," "keeps a reader from mistaking one for the other." The adjective list is the gate, since "keep the buffer small" is ordinary English with most adjectives; the kept ones cost seven corpus hits. The causative "keeps X from being invoked" and "keeps X out of Y" stay out as the corpora's own "prevents."
- **FigurativeEarns** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Every form of "earn," banned outright: a rule that "earns its keep," a helper that "earns a caveat," a shell that "earns full branch coverage," trust that "is earned," a "well-earned" promotion. The earning shapes lived in `AnthropomorphicJustification` as curated possessive idioms, grant-object lists, and a determiner-gated subject shape, and each gate let another inflection through ("Every shell earns full branch coverage" slipped the determiner list), so the maintainer banned the verb instead: one bare token flags every form, the literal person-subject uses included. The Go standard library uses no form of the verb at all, and the Python standard library's only occurrences are one repeated spam-email test fixture, so technical prose loses nothing. The nominal vocabulary stays quiet ("earnings," "earner," "earnest"); payroll, tax, and finance prose disables the rule, and a dedicated rule means doing so costs none of `AnthropomorphicJustification`'s remaining coverage.
- **BareNames** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The designation verb with an inanimate subject: "the manifest names the tag," "the field names the target," "the plain sentence names the step," "a recipe names a gate," "it names a kind of file," "the rejections named figurative language," "an identifier naming an object." `AnthropomorphicJustification` had left the verb alone on corpus evidence, because Go and Python documentation use it for what an identifier denotes ("the path names a directory"), and `CommitFigurativeVerbs` covered it only where a commit message is the text; the maintainer then met it in every document that passed under the package and asked for the verb flagged wherever a thing names a thing. An open determiner-gated subject with the pronoun and relative subjects, the bare plural, the modal, the gerund, and a dotted filename ("vendir.yml names the tag") as companions; the object gates on its own determiner so the plural noun ("the type names that appear") stays quiet, and the people and bodies that literally give or publish a name sit in the exceptions. The cost is about fifteen hits across the two standard libraries, flagged on the maintainer's call; API reference prose disables the rule per file.
- **NamedAdjective** (`ai-tells`): New rule. "Named" as a pointer adjective: "the named file," "the named recipe," "each named rule," "its named target," the same designation as `BareNames` worn as a modifier, flagged on the maintainer's ask alongside the verb. Takes "named" from `EmptyPadding` and `EmptyPaddingStacked`, whose tagger-driven pair flagged every "named pipe" with an instruction to delete the word. Gated on the definite determiner, so "a named type," "named pipes," and "a named tuple" (a thing that has a name, as opposed to an anonymous one) stay quiet, with a lookahead over the terms of art that keep that sense under "the" too ("the named group"); the participle ("the file named foo") never puts the adjective beside the determiner, and the legal and meteorology terms ("the named party," "the named storm") sit in the exceptions. The cost is the API idiom itself, about 230 hits across the Go and Python standard libraries, most of them "the named file" and "the named directory"; with `BareHolds` it is one of the loudest rules in the package on reference prose, and a project documenting an API disables it per file.

### Fixed

- **SentenceStartRepetition**, **SentenceStartEntropy**, **SentenceLengthVariance**, **ParagraphLengthVariance**, **ContentDuplication**, **ContractionAvoidance**, **PassiveDensity**, **TransitionRepetition**, and **TricolonDensityDocument** (`ai-tells-experimental`): The raw-scope scripts now strip the markup an MDX or HTML document puts between paragraphs before measuring: JSX and HTML tags with their attributes, MDX expression lines and comments, `import` and `export` statements, and a frontmatter block. Left in place, a component tag read as the first word of the sentence after it, so a page built from repeated `<Callout>` blocks tripped `SentenceStartRepetition` on the tag rather than the prose, and a self-closing `<Image />` line on its own entered the paragraph-split scripts as a paragraph. A new `test-mdx.md` fixture holds such a page, and the test gate raises every raw-scope rule to error over it. The fixture keeps a `.md` extension because Vale parses `.mdx` through the external `mdx2vast` tool, which the pinned toolchain lacks, while the scripts read the raw text whatever the extension.

### Changed

- **EmptyPadding** and **EmptyPaddingStacked** (`ai-tells`): "Named" left both modifier lists for the new `NamedAdjective`, which gates it on the definite determiner and keeps the terms of art ("a named pipe," "named types," "a named tuple") quiet. The tagger-driven pair had flagged every one, and the README listed "named pipe" as a known cost; the other modifiers are unchanged.
- **NegatedSubject** (`ai-tells`): A documentation-corpus audit found the copula token missing the "gets" auxiliary ("No row ever gets deleted"), an adjective predicate ("No freeze is anonymous"), an intransitive verb ("No operational driver appears in the code"), the pronoun subjects "Nothing," "None of," and "Neither," and the relative-clause negated subject ("a row whose key no root reaches," "a file that no manifest names"), which is lowercase by nature and gates the word before "no" so `NegatedObject`'s shapes stay with it. All five joined at about fifty corpus hits between them, the same human caveat register the copula token already accepts. Then, on the maintainer's ask to strengthen the negation pair past the audit, the copula slot took the modal, perfect, and progressive auxiliaries ("No data will be collected," "No lock needs to be held"), the intransitive verb took a modal ("No warning should occur"), "Nothing" took the copula ("Nothing is collected"), the "Zero" spelling joined with the curated predicates ("Zero configuration is required," while "Zero padding is allowed" stays quiet), the intensified subject joined ("Not a single line is wasted"), and the mid-sentence declarative after "and," "but," or "because" joined in lowercase ("and no data is lost"); "so no adjustment is needed" stays out as the consequence idiom and "None is returned" as Python's literal.
- **NegatedObject** (`ai-tells`): The "nothing" spelling of the shifted negation now fires over the operations and possession verbs ("writes nothing of its own," "costs nothing," "deletes nothing," "holds nothing but derived data"), at about thirty corpus hits; "does nothing" stays out at 134 as the corpora's own name for a no-op. On the maintainer's ask, each verb token also takes an intensifier ahead of "no" ("requires absolutely no configuration," "adds virtually no overhead"), the bare intensified absence fires on its own ("absolutely no data"), and the prepositional spelling fires behind the verbs that make a reassurance of it ("ships with no dependencies," "runs with zero configuration," "installs without any changes") and behind the reassurance nouns whatever the verb ("with no configuration," "with no vendor lock-in"); "with no changes" stays out as the diff register.
- **PassiveVoice**, **PassiveVoiceAdverb**, and **PassiveDensity** (`ai-tells-experimental`): The "get" passive ("gets created," "got deleted," "get compared") joins the auxiliary list in all three, after the audit found every one of those escaping.
- **FigurativeCarries** (`ai-tells`): The bare "carry" a plural subject or a relative pronoun proves is the verb now fires ("the machine formats carry the score columns," "the blobs that carry no state rows," "the tier other stages carry"), at one corpus hit for the plural and two for the relative shape, both the arithmetic verb the trailing lookahead now refuses. The bare plural with no determiner stays out, because the arithmetic noun sits in that slot sixteen times over.
- **FigurativeSurfaces**, **FigurativeClears**, **FigurativeQuiet**, **FigurativeFires**, **EvasionMetaphors**, **FigurativeTravels**, and **FigurativeSweeps** (`ai-tells`): The one-token misses the audit found. `FigurativeSurfaces` takes a bare-noun object ("Surfaces skills whose definition matches"); `FigurativeClears` takes the bound and pass nouns ("clears the target," "cleared the run") and the intransitive "clears on the next run," while "clears it" stays out as the deletion sense; `FigurativeQuiet` takes "silent" and "mute" beside "quiet" and the imposed silence "keeps the console quiet"; `FigurativeFires` takes the pronoun subject ("they fire nothing," "so it fires nothing") and "misfire"; `EvasionMetaphors` takes "lets violations into," "past," "by," and "out"; `FigurativeTravels` replaces its curated data-noun subject with an open determiner-gated one and a widened destination set ("the precomputed digests travel into that bundle"); and `FigurativeSweeps` takes the bare removal of records ("Sweep the failures," "sweeps every stranded row"). Every addition measures at zero to three corpus hits.
- **FigurativeSits**, **FigurativeOwns**, **FigurativeLives**, **FigurativeStays**, **FigurativeFalls**, and **FigurativeWins** (`ai-tells`): The subject-shape gaps the audit found. `FigurativeSits` admits a modifier in the open subject ("an orphan row sits on a record"), a pronoun subject ("these sit ahead of"), the inverted order ("over each column sits an index," "beside it sit flat columns"), and the posture complement ("sits quoted and escaped"). `FigurativeOwns` takes the component that owns the table it writes ("the table it owns," "it owns three tables," "the columns each stage owns," "the docs that own the decision cut," "no owning component"), at eleven corpus hits in the runtime register the exceptions already name. `FigurativeLives` takes the bare-noun subject ("Free-block bloat lives in the file layout," "operator mechanics live elsewhere") and the "as" complement, leaving "this lives in" and the compiler's liveness vocabulary out. `FigurativeStays` replaces its eight curated adjectives with an open determiner-gated state complement plus a grown bare-verb list ("stays complete," "stays optional," "stays deterministic," "stays put"), at about twenty-five corpus hits with "remains" or "is" as the plain word, leaving "stays in sync" out. `FigurativeFalls` takes the bare category sort ("falls into one of three dispositions"), the bounded placement ("falls within the window"), and the numeric floor ("fell under the floor"); "falls back to" stays out at 219 corpus hits as the plain name for a second choice. `FigurativeWins` now fires on the contest with an inanimate subject ("a lower index wins," "one item per group wins as primary," "losers then split," "picking a winner," "outranks," "beats an explicit flag") and on "kicks off," reversing the earlier call that left the precedence sense alone, at twenty-four corpus hits each and on the maintainer's direction; the beings who literally win sit in new exceptions, and "races" and "dominates" stay out as the data race and the dominator tree.
- **AnthropomorphicCognition** (`ai-tells`): The judgment verbs behind the determiner-gated subject ("a record's bytes decide which extractor runs," "the library decides for itself," "prose answers questions," "determinism forbids a model," "arbitrates," "cedes," "adopts"), the fallible artifact ("the loader could mistake X for Y," "one scan can't prove," "the parser guesses"), the artifact that asks for, hunts, or pretends, the failure text that "tells you to" refresh, and transitive "confuse" ("characters that confuse tokenization") all join, with "decides" at twenty-three corpus hits and "confuse" at fifteen the loud ones. The ditransitive teaching frame ("would teach a reviewer the wrong contract," "teaches the reviewer a contract") takes a lookahead-only span listed ahead of the general token, because the general token puts the pupil inside its span and the human-pupil exceptions were dropping it. Bare "behave" (twenty-eight hits, no complement to gate on), "objects" as a verb (its noun floods every gate), and "refuses" (the plain verb this package recommends for a check that rejects its input) stay out.
- **UniversalObject** and **UniversalSubject** (`ai-tells`): `UniversalObject` admits the base verb behind a plural subject directly ahead of it ("content rules cover every input"), the one base form that is a claim rather than aspiration, at one corpus hit. `UniversalSubject` takes the quantified subject doing one thing to one object ("Every predicate reads a live root," "All rows carry a timestamp"), a curated-verb shape that costs about twenty-five hits in the spec-truth register the copula token already accepts.
- **FigurativeIdioms**, **ColloquialAssessments**, **JourneyMetaphors**, **FigurativePays**, **EnforcementMetaphors**, and **FigurativeQuantities** (`ai-tells`): The idioms and figures the audit found clearing every rule. `FigurativeIdioms` takes "lines up with," "doubles as," "double duty," "the whole trick," "a step further," "meets that bar," "on hand," "went missing," "went away," "for good" (with "for good measure" refused), "made that call," "judgment call," "takes a while," "gets it backwards," "picks up on," "from two angles," "stands up a service," and the bare "fans out"; "survives the rebase untouched" moved to `MortalityMetaphors`, and "goes away" stays out at sixty-one hits. `ColloquialAssessments` takes "handy for" and "comes in handy." `JourneyMetaphors` takes "made it through," "makes it into," and "walks the workflow." `FigurativePays` takes the invoice spelled with "cost" ("never pays that cost," "at no cost," "would pay to compare," "spends work"), leaving bare "cheap" out at fifty-two hits. `EnforcementMetaphors` takes candor credited to a number ("an honest count," "the honest decode," "keeps a before-and-after comparison honest") and gating as a verb ("the root that gates it," "the live roots gate every table," "to gate a security control"), at eight Go-comment hits. `FigurativeQuantities` takes distance standing in for a count ("how far one label reaches").
- **FillerPhrases** (`ai-tells`) and **CommitOverexplanation** (`ai-tells-commits`): Both messages said the flagged phrase "adds nothing," which the new `NegatedObject` token flags in the message linter; each now says the sentence reads the same without it.
- **FigurativeCarries** (`ai-tells`): A negated-cargo token now takes the object left open ("it carries no counts and no dates," "carries zero overhead"). `NegatedObject` leaves "carries no" to this rule, but the content and policy tokens gate on head-noun lists and the open-subject shape gates on a determiner-fronted subject, so a pronoun subject with an unlisted noun escaped both. The Go and Python standard libraries show the open shape once across 1.3M lines ("carry no data," which the content token already flags), and `NegatedObject`'s degree and count lookahead gates carry over, so "carries no more than three" and "carries zero or more" stay quiet. The object slot matches `NegatedObject`'s exactly: a quote mark may open the object, and a backticked object matches through the asterisk run Vale's markdown parser masks the code span to, so the quoted and backticked spellings flag alongside the bare one.
- **AnthropomorphicJustification** (`ai-tells`): The earning family moved out to `FigurativeEarns`, described above. The handing shape stays, and its subject gate now accepts "every" and "each" ("every guard hands the merge a clean start").
- **NegatedObject** (`ai-tells`): The object slot now accepts a quoted object ("listed no 'every'", the miss that prompted the change) and the masked span a backticked object becomes: Vale's markdown parser rewrites "no `every`" to one asterisk per character before the rule reads the text, so the slot matches an asterisk run, and a literal backtick in the quote class covers parses that never strip code spans. The verb groups also grow the reporting, perception, privacy-claim, and idiom vocabulary the construction attracts in AI prose: "list" (the original miss), "report," "detect," "observe," "notice," "encounter," "experience," "reveal," "surface," "flag," "disclose," "present" (finite forms only, keeping "at present no fix exists" quiet), "publish," "export," "request," "attempt," "tolerate," "sacrifice," and "trust" join the claims group; "transmit," "persist," "query," "contact," "ping," "cache," "copy," "duplicate," "overwrite," "embed," "bundle," "acquire," "access," "capture," "apply," "enforce," "fork," "push," "schedule," "queue," "suppress," "reserve," and "occupy" join the operations group ("transmits no telemetry," "contacts no external servers," "acquires no locks"); and "own," "pay," "spend," "suffer," and "brook" join the possession idioms ("pays no attention," "suffers no fools," "brooks no argument"). Every candidate ran against the Go and Python standard libraries first. The kept verbs cost about ten hits led by "reports no such host," and the corpora keep out the clausal family ("ensure no" at 16 hits, "check no" at 6), the docs formulas ("finds no" at 10, "matches no" at 7), and the caller-side condition frames ("pass no arguments," "specify no timeout"), with the counts recorded in the rule comment.

## [1.31.0] - 2026-08-16

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **UniversalObject** and **UniversalSubject** (`ai-tells`): Two new rules, the totality mirror of the negation pair: where `NegatedObject` and `NegatedSubject` catch the register that announces absence, these catch the same voice claiming a clean sweep of an unnamed universe. `UniversalObject` takes the quantifier on the object ("handles all edge cases," "eliminates all ambiguity," "meets every requirement," "solves all of the problems"), with a verb list measured against the Go and Python standard libraries: the operations family ("returns all matches," "removes all elements") is ordinary documentation at hundreds of hits and stays out wholesale, while the surviving self-grading verbs cost 36 hits, one of them Python's own joke docstring, the tell itself. Base verb forms stay out entirely, because modals, infinitives, and imperatives take the bare verb, so the aspiration register of a TODO never fires. `UniversalSubject` takes the quantifier promoted to subject with a copula reporting the sweep complete ("All edge cases are handled," "Every effort has been made"), plus the uncounted test scoreboard ("All tests pass," "All checks green"); its predicate slot accepts any participle, the sentence-initial capital is the declarative gate its negated sibling already uses, and the documented corpus cost is 86 hits led by the uniformity sweep of ordinary specification prose, a register the rule takes by design once the shape floods AI prose. The quantifier floats ("X, Y, and Z are all copied") stay out on structure rather than cost: they resume a list the subject just named instead of sweeping an unnamed universe.
- **FigurativeSweeps** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Extends the figurative-verb family to wholesale motion: a change that "sweeps away" the old behavior, a refactor making "sweeping changes," a problem "swept under the rug," reviewers "swept up in" the excitement, a trend that "swept through" the industry, plus the totality idioms "a clean sweep," "in one sweep," and "one fell swoop." Every token is complement-gated and measured against the Go and Python standard libraries, where the verb's entire presence is the mark-and-sweep collector and a few algorithmic passes; the one match is a Go comment copying registers "in one fell swoop," the tell itself. The audit-pass noun ("a sweep over the docs") stays uncovered as established programmer usage.
- **ExplainerLeads** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports the free relative ("what/why/how the \<subject\> \<verb\>") used as a framing device in prose: the cleft lead-in ("Here's what the change does," "This is why the pin matters," "That's how the pieces fit"), the label before a colon ("What the hook does: it refuses the write," bold markers included), and the sentence-initial pseudo-cleft ("What the hook does is refuse the write," "What this means is"). Every shape gates the subject behind a determiner, so the embedded clause doing real work mid-sentence ("depends on how the shell resolves it") stays out. When and where stay out of the label and pseudo-cleft shapes because a capitalized "When the input is 6:" opens an ordinary conditional clause, which the Go and Python standard libraries confirm is common human prose; measured corpus cost across 1.3M lines is fourteen hits, each one the construction itself rather than a lookalike.
- **JourneyMetaphors** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The project narrated as travel: lessons learned "along the way," support "every step of the way," a fix that "is on the way" or "well on its way," a bug that "found its way into" production, groundwork that "paves the way," progress that "goes a long way," "a path forward," "on a path to," "on the road to," "bumps in the road," problems "down the road" or "down the line," "en route to," and the determiner-gated "journey." Measured against the Go and Python standard libraries: "along the way" costs nineteen hits, almost all the incidental-work idiom of traversal narration ("creates missing directories along the way"), a flag-hard token by the maintainer's call because the same phrase in documentation and commit prose waves at unnamed side work instead of naming it; the other shapes cost eight combined, each the figure itself. Measured out: bare "on the way," which the corpora use for the manner sense ("depends on the way that...") and the entry-and-exit idiom ("closed on the way out"); "on the path to," whose every corpus hit is a literal pointer or tree path; and the first-person "work our way down" traversal narration. "Paving the way" stays in `AICompoundPhrases`, "Embark on a journey" in `OpeningCliches`, and "the user journey" stays quiet as a UX term of art; travel writing disables the rule.
- **NominalizedScopeChange** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The change-as-noun: "the widening covers the inflections," "after the narrowing, alerts stay identical," "the tightening of the gate," "this broadening adds three tokens." Naming an edit by its direction of travel instead of naming the rule and what it catches now, a habit the maintainer flagged in drafts written for this repository, the same route that put "measured cost" into `FigurativeIdioms`. Gated on a determiner plus a scope-change gerund followed by punctuation, a preposition, or a common predicate verb, so the adjectival reading ("the widening gap," "a narrowing conversion") stays quiet without a noun blocklist. Determiner-plus-gerund shapes for all five words measured zero across the Go standard library comments and once in the Python standard library ("applying the narrowing to a block of code," in the typing docs), the package's usual tolerance; prose about type narrowing or compiler conversions disables the rule.
- **FigurativeReaches** (`ai-tells`): New rule. "Reaches for" as selection described as motion: prose that "reaches for the same verb," a rule that "reached for a curated list," writers who "reach for a metaphor." An open determiner-gated subject in the FigurativeLands mold with the beings and limbs that literally reach listed as exceptions, a curated bare-subject shape for "AI reaches for," and a complement gate on the writing-device nouns whatever the subject. Every inflected shape measured zero across the Go and Python standard libraries; the corpora's one figurative use ("what people reach for when debugging") is a bare verb on a bare human subject, outside every gated shape. "Out of reach" stays in `FigurativeIdioms` and "reach out" in `ClosingPleasantries`.
- **FigurativeSettles** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The settlement figure gathered into one place: the gavel moved from `AnthropomorphicJustification` ("availability settles the question," "the reconfirmation settles it," "a classifier settles those"), the dust idiom ("once the dust settles," "the dust settled after the reorg," "wait for the dust to settle"), settling into stability ("the API settled into its final shape," "settled into a rhythm," "settled into place"), the closed question ("the debate is settled," "consider it settled," "settled law," "far from settled"), and the score ("settles an old score"). Every token measured zero across the Go and Python standard libraries except "once the dust settles," twice in Go comments, the established programmer idiom flagged on purpose. The corpora's own settle vocabulary is the convergence register ("the pacer settles into a non-degenerate state," workers that "settle into cond.wait()"), whose complements stay outside every gated list, so control-loop prose stays quiet. The choice senses ("settled on a heuristic," "settle for the simpler form"), "settle ties," settlers, and dust landing on a surface stay quiet too; legal and geology prose disable the rule.
- **HouseStyle** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The "house" compound for a project's own conventions: "the house style," "house tics," "the house formula," "the house voice," "house idioms." Agent prose picks up the figure whenever it writes about a repo's rules, this repository's own comments included. The first substitution rule in the core style, so each finding carries its mechanical correction (house becomes project) and fix-prose-replacements can splice it without judgment. A lookbehind keeps the hyphenated compound quiet ("our in-house style guide"), and every key measured zero across the Go and Python standard libraries.
- **FigurativeQuantities** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Quantity expressed through a physical metaphor instead of a number: "a handful of tests," "a smattering of users," "a slew of warnings," "a host of options," "a boatload of," "a ton of," "a heap of," "a mountain of," "a sea of," "a flood of," "a wave of," "an avalanche of," the mixture metaphors "a smorgasbord of," "a patchwork of," "a mosaic of," and "a constellation of," and "array" when an adjective inflates it ("a vast array of"). Each phrase is what a model reaches for when told to remove one of the others, so the whole substitution pool shares one rule and one message naming the exit: give the count, or write "a few" or "many." "A handful" measured 14 times across the Go and Python standard libraries as the ordinary human idiom, so it is a flag-hard token by the maintainer's call rather than a pure fingerprint.
- **AnthropomorphicCognition** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports cognition and volition handed to an artifact: a spec that "wants" a retry, a dependency bump that "wants merging," a release that "teaches" a skill, a dictionary that "learns" a word, a manager that "knows nothing about" a path, a script that "asks whether," a tool that "trusts" its inputs, a parser that "gets confused," a workflow that "misbehaves," and text "telling the truth." The wanting shape is an open determiner-gated subject with the people who legitimately think listed as exceptions, so "the user wants a report" stays quiet, and a lookbehind drops the participle inversion ("somebody installing a binary wants an install line"). An earlier audit left volition uncovered for want of a gate; the inverted subject gate is that gate. Left uncovered on measurement: "doesn't know," which the Go and Python standard libraries use over thirty times, and the participial "misbehaving client," established vocabulary for an adversarial peer.
- **EnforcementMetaphors** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports a check presented as a sentry: a guard that "stands down," a gate left "armed," a linter that "keeps its teeth" or turns "toothless," a workflow that "polices" an arrangement, a formatter that would "fight" the installer for a tree, gates that "keep them honest," a grant nothing "stands behind," a skill that "stood in the way," "left standing," and a rule that would "flood." The arming shape gates on enforcement nouns, so "arming the ping timer" stays quiet.
- **EvasionMetaphors** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports a miss framed as an escape: a defect that "slipped through" or "slips past," a filter that "let it through," a rule people "route around" or "go around," a change that "snuck past" or "sidesteps" a guard, and a gap that "went unnoticed" or "goes unreported." "Dodges" and "sails through" stay in FigurativeIdioms, which owned them first. The going-around object set keeps "go around the loop," the iteration idiom, quiet.
- **FigurativeOwns** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports responsibility by possession: a tool that "owns" a directory, a rule that "owns" a phrase, an installer that "owns" the deployed tree, "the owning rule." Exceptions carry the two registers where ownership is literal or established: concurrency and memory management (a goroutine owns a lock, a caller owns a buffer) and legal ownership (copyright, trademarks).
- **FigurativeClears** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports passing described as a jump: a draft that "clears the gate," a message that "cleared every check," a fix "clearing a finding," a branch that "clears CI." The checking noun after the verb is the gate, so clearing a cache or a screen stays quiet.
- **FigurativeSurfaces** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports discovery as emergence: drift that "surfaces" on a change, an audit that "surfaced a defect," "nothing surfaced this earlier." Gated on a complement or a defect-family subject, so the API surface and the road surface stay quiet.
- **FigurativeDisguises** (`ai-tells`): New rule. The disguise frame, the sibling of the substitution verb in `FigurativeIdioms`: an opinion "disguised as" a question, complexity "masquerading as" rigor, a rewrite "dressed up as" a refactor, a fix "parading as" a feature, an ad "posing as" a review, a form "pretending to be" a conversation, "what passes for" documentation, a wrapper that "passes itself off as" the original, a spreadsheet "cosplaying as" a database, plus the noun forms "in disguise," "under the guise of," "in sheep's clothing," and the stacked impostors "in a trench coat." The verbs match inflected forms only, so the noun homographs (a party disguise, a masquerade ball, a parade route, salad dressing) stay quiet; the comparison shape ("poses as much risk as it removes"), the mathematical "posed as," the bare "passes for the wrong reason," the scheduling "pass kicked off as," and the literal impersonation of the Windows security API all stay uncovered. The corpora's four hits (pointers "disguised as" uintptrs, commits "masquerading as" real ones, garbage "in the guise of" 7-bit us-ascii, class instances that "pretend to be" numbers) are the literal technical senses, tolerated as flag-hard costs; security, forensics, and test-double prose should disable the rule. The messages on `FigurativeLoud` and `FigurativeQuiet` and a half-dozen rule comments used the frame themselves and are reworded to clear it.

### Changed

- **ExplainerHeadings** (`ai-tells`): Generalized. The rule knew the pronoun-subject forms by name ("Why It Matters," "What It Does") but missed the same heading with a real subject. A new determiner-gated token catches "Why the Pin Exists," "How the Cache Works," "What the Data Shows," and the when/where/who variants, while "How to Configure X" and "What's New" stay out for lack of a determiner.
- **FigurativeHolds** (`ai-tells`): Widened. The idiom and promise families gain their past-tense forms ("held water," "held sway," "held the key to," "held the line," "held court," "held at scale"), the line idiom takes the full inflection group ("holding the line"), and the subject-gated survival family gains the progressive with an optional copula ("the trend is still holding"), with the copula paired to the progressive alone so passive belief ("the assumption is widely held") stays out. A new constraint family catches the verb restricting a resource to a bound ("holding network access to an approved-domain allowlist," "held costs to a minimum," "holds request rates to under 100"), gated on the determiner-plus-bound-noun complement after "to"; the gated shape has zero literal hits in the Python standard library, whose hold-to prose concerns references and pointers.
- **FillerPhrases** (`ai-tells`): "A myriad of," "a plethora of," and "a wealth of" migrated to `FigurativeQuantities`, whose message names the correction those phrases need.
- **FigurativeIdioms** (`ai-tells`): A third token group from a retroactive audit of the toolchain repositories' commit histories: "closes the gap," "in lockstep," "in step with," "point of no return," "under its own power," "covers more ground," "brings into line," walking a decision back, main "moving under" a branch, the dogfooding family ("eats its own cooking," "dogfoods," "drinks its own champagne"), "sleeping dogs," and a release "fanning out" into pull requests. Only the fanning verb with a destination matches; the compound nouns "fan-out," "fanout," and "fan-in" are legitimate concurrency and circuit vocabulary and stay untouched.
- **FigurativeFalls** (`ai-tells`): The past tenses join every token ("fell short," "had fallen behind," "fell through the cracks"), each measured at zero across the Go and Python standard libraries. "Fell into place" stays in NarrativePivots. The membership token also accepts "falls inside."
- **FigurativeStays** (`ai-tells`): Added "stayed behind" for work personified as the one not picked.
- **FigurativeRides** (`ai-tells`): The piggybacking family adds "rides alongside" and "rides through."
- **AnthropomorphicJustification** (`ai-tells`): The reflexive arm adds the self-report verbs ("declares itself," "announces itself," "proves itself," "reports itself," "versions itself") and the voice figure ("speaks up"). The pronoun-object adjudication shape adds the plurals ("settles those"). The settle shapes then left with the rest of that verb, the gavel to the new `FigurativeSettles` and the invoice to `FigurativePays`, so the adjudication family keeps "decides the debate," "puts the matter to rest," and "lays the issue to rest."
- **FigurativePays** (`ai-tells`): Gains the settled invoice from `AnthropomorphicJustification` ("settled the cost," "settles up," "squares the ledger," "balances the books"), widened on the way over: the determiner set now matches the payoff token and the optional middle word takes a possessive, the two openings that let "The Go and Python standard libraries settled each token's cost" through the narrower shape in a merged commit message. Every widened shape still measures zero across those same libraries.
- **RedundantPrecaution** (`ai-tells`): Added the British variant, "belt and braces."

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.30.0] - 2026-08-16

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **FillerIntensifier** (`ai-tells`): New rule. Reports "single" and its cousins riding a determiner that already carries the count: "a single command," "one single flag," "every single time," "no single point of failure," "any single failure," "the single source of truth," plus "a lone exception," "its sole purpose," "a mere formality," "one solitary warning," "a singular focus," and "any one of the checks," which is what "any single" turns into when a writer dodges the alert. Deleting the modifier costs those phrases nothing, which is what makes it an intensifier. The "no single" and "any single" arms are deliberately broad on the package's flag-hard stance: "no single component owns this" needs a recast rather than a deletion, and the alert is there to force that choice. Hyphenated compounds ("a single-threaded server"), grammar's "the singular form," pronoun heads ("no one," "each one," "every one"), and "the single most important," which `AbsoluteAssertions` already owns, all stay out.
- **FigurativeFires**, **FigurativeTrips**, **FigurativeSees**, **FigurativeTravels**, **FigurativeBreeds**, **FigurativeDemands**, **FigurativeLives**, **FigurativeStays** (`ai-tells`): Eight new rules extending the figurative-verb family to the personifying verbs that had no coverage: a rule that "fires," prose that "trips the linter," a library that "sees heavy use," a request that "travels through the stack," complexity that "breeds confusion," a migration that "demands care," config that "lives in" a file, and a check that "stays green." Every token measured against the Go and Python standard libraries; FigurativeLives and the widened FigurativeCarries flip the family's usual curated-subject wordlist into an open determiner-gated subject with the literal actors listed as exceptions, the FigurativeLands model, because the figurative subjects proved open-ended while the literal ones are a small closed set.

### Changed

- **FigurativeCarries** (`ai-tells`): Widened. New tokens catch the typographic cargo ("carries a repotools prefix," "carries a suffix"), the mirrored possession ("carries the same caveat"), and any determiner-gated subject ("the manifest carries the pin"), with common literal carriers (vehicles, couriers, disease vectors, wires, Go's Context) as exceptions and the arithmetic carry noun excluded by requiring an inflected verb.
- **FigurativeLands** (`ai-tells`): Widened. New tokens catch the perfect and adverbial arrival ("the fix has finally landed," "support landed upstream," "lands as a single commit"), the bare arrival at a clause boundary ("once merged, the fix lands."), and the transitive landing ("landed a fix," "landing it means"). New exceptions cover the achievement and athletic idioms ("landed a job," "lands the jump").
- **FigurativeIdioms** (`ai-tells`): Added the reduction idioms ("comes down to," "boils down to," complement-gated "came down to") and the substitution verb ("stands in for"). The stand-in noun stays uncovered as the ordinary word for a placeholder.
- **AnthropomorphicJustification** (`ai-tells`): The agency family adds "forms an opinion."
- **CommitFigurativeVerbs** (`ai-tells-commits`): Added the determiner-gated residence shape ("the config lives in").

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.29.0] - 2026-08-03

<!-- vale off -->

### Changed

- **Packaging**: `ai-tells.zip` now takes the wrapper shape (a
  top-level directory holding a `styles/` subtree) that
  `ai-tells-experimental.zip` already used, and carries
  `styles/config/templates/ai-tells-agent.tmpl`. A `vale sync` lands
  the styles at `StylesPath/ai-tells/` from either shape and the
  template at `StylesPath/config/templates/`, so
  `--output=ai-tells-agent.tmpl` resolves for a repository syncing the
  core style alone. The template used to ship only in the opt-in
  experimental package, where a consumer without it got a template
  runtime error rather than a report. `ai-tells-experimental.zip` no
  longer carries the file, which leaves one publisher per path and no
  way for two copies to disagree. `ai-tells-commits.zip` is unchanged.
  Existing pins name a release, so a consumer sees the new layout on
  its next version bump.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.28.0] - 2026-08-02

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **NegationDensity** (`ai-tells-experimental`): New rule. Counts the
  determiner heading a negated noun phrase and reports a paragraph
  holding more than two of them. Each instance is correct English and
  reads fine alone, so the rule measures rate rather than judging any
  single use, in the way `TricolonDensityDocument` does for a structure
  its per-instance sibling cannot see. Agent-authored prose runs these
  at close to triple the rate of the Go and Python standard libraries.
  Warning level, matching the other density rules.

- **CommitFigurativeVerbs** and **CommitGitJargon**
  (`ai-tells-commits`): New rules drawn from commit messages a
  maintainer sent back across the four toolchain repositories. The
  first reports figurative verbs taking an inanimate subject, the
  second bare git nouns left unexplained. Both stay scoped to commit
  messages, because the same shapes are ordinary elsewhere: a table
  really does hold values, and outside a repository those nouns mean
  syntax trees and array indices.

- **FigurativeIdioms** (`ai-tells`): New rule for fixed figurative
  phrases standing in for a plain statement of what happened. A whole
  idiom leaves no literal reading to protect, so no subject gate is
  needed. Disable it for runtime and memory-management prose, where a
  value is literally out of reach.

- **Agent output template**: `styles/config/templates/ai-tells-agent.tmpl`
  prints one line per finding, carrying the location, the severity, the
  rule name, the exact matched text, and the replacement when a rule
  defines one, followed by a totals line. Vale's default report spreads a
  finding across two lines and omits the match, so a coding assistant has
  to reopen the file before it can act on one. The template sits beside
  the Tengo scripts under `styles/config`, which carries it into
  `ai-tells-experimental.zip`. Invoke it with
  `vale --output=ai-tells-agent.tmpl`.

### Changed

- **FigurativeSits**: Two tokens for placement where the complement
  proves nothing and the subject carries the discriminator. One curates
  the subject to parts of a document or a config; the other leaves it
  open and accepts literal placement as a known cost, which the rule
  header already tells furniture and layout prose to disable.

- **FigurativeCarries**: A token for a file or a section treated as the
  bearer of a policy rather than the place the policy is written. The
  lookahead now excludes the phrasal senses on both sides, so bringing
  a setting forward from a previous release stays clean.

- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Tokens for the typographic and
  structural grant, for the bare earning and handing shapes with an
  open object, and for adjudication where the object collapses to a
  pronoun. The file also records three verbs left uncovered on corpus
  evidence, so a later audit does not reopen them without new data.

- **README**: The commit-msg hook snippet now names `vale-cli/vale` at a
  frozen revision. The `errata-ai` repository stopped publishing that hook
  after 3.13, so the old snippet pinned a revision that no longer receives
  updates. A new section lists the recipes that gate this repository and
  names the container runtime that two of them need.

### Fixed

- **VerbTricolonDensity**: The alert printed a Go format error where the
  match count belonged, because the message asked for a string and the
  occurrence extension passes an integer.

- **VerbTricolon**: Matches no longer run past the sentence they start
  in. Vale flattens a document to one string before matching, and the
  gaps between items excluded only the comma, so clauses drawn from
  separate sentences read as one series. A Conventional Commits subject
  carries no terminal punctuation either, which let the colon after the
  type reach into the body and pair the subject with commas from prose
  holding no tricolon at all.

## [1.27.2] - 2026-08-01

<!-- vale off -->

### Fixed

- **ColloquialAssessments**, **DefensiveHedges**, **Metacommentary**,
  **MicDrop**, **MicDropHeadings**, **ParallelStaccato**,
  **RhetoricalDevices**, **RhetoricalSelfAnswer**, **StackedAnaphora**:
  Anchor the tokens at word boundaries. These rules set `nonword: true`,
  which drops the boundaries Vale adds by default on both ends, so 280
  tokens could start matching inside a word and 42 could match the front
  of a longer one. An audit of every rule carrying that setting found
  these nine. ColloquialAssessments was reachable from ordinary prose
  because it also folds case, and a word such as "blithe" ends with the
  article the token starts with. The rest needed a capital letter inside
  a word, which happens when a camel case identifier appears in a
  sentence. MicDropHeadings also matched the front of a longer adverb, so
  a heading that ended in "secondly" tripped the token ending in
  "second". Alerts on the fixtures and across the consumer repositories
  are unchanged.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.27.1] - 2026-07-31

<!-- vale off -->

### Fixed

- **ContractionAvoidance**: Count contractions written with the typographic
  apostrophe (U+2019). Every pattern in the script used the straight
  apostrophe, so a document that went through a typographer counted as
  having no contractions at all and tripped the rule regardless of how it
  was written. The script now normalizes the apostrophe before counting.
- **VerbTricolon**: Anchor every token that begins with a word character at
  a word boundary. The rule sets `nonword: true`, which suppresses the
  boundaries Vale adds by default, so a token that leads with a literal
  word matched inside longer words. Prose naming an identifier that ends
  in "can" tripped the modal token, and words such as "into" and "bayou"
  tripped the infinitive and pronoun tokens. Tokens that lead with `\w+`
  never had the problem, because a match found inside a word is also found
  from the word start, so `VerbTricolonDensity` needed no change. This
  narrows the rule and drops false positives only. Alerts on the test
  fixtures are unchanged.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.27.0] - 2026-07-31

<!-- vale off -->

### Changed

- **EmphaticCopula**: Add six italicized intensifiers (actually, really,
  never, always, truly, literally) in both the asterisk and the underscore
  form, so the rule covers stress italics alongside the copula pattern it
  started with. The message now says "common word" instead of "copula",
  which the determiner and conjunction tokens had already outgrown. Vale
  3.17 added an `emphasis` scope that reads these spans without markup
  patterns, but that scope aborts the whole style on older Vale, so the
  rule stays on `scope: raw` until a dedicated inline-scope package lands.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.26.0] - 2026-07-27

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **DoubleHyphen**: New rule. Splits the literal double-hyphen token out
  of `EmDashUsage` into a dedicated rule whose message gives the two real
  fixes: backtick it when it is a CLI flag or literal, or use a real em
  dash character when it is punctuation. `EmDashUsage` keeps the true em
  dash tokens and its own message. Brings the main-style rule count to 77.
- **Fixture CI gate**: New `just test` recipe suite and a `lint.yml` step
  that run `test-document.md` and `test-commit-messages.md` through
  `.vale-test.ini` and assert both fire a healthy volume of errors, while
  `test-false-positives.md` stays clean. Adds a `CommitPastTense` smoke
  test that feeds single subject lines through Vale, since the rule's raw
  anchor only sees line 1 and the corpus fixture cannot exercise it.
  Positive fixtures were also added for the 14 main rules that never fired
  on `test-document.md`.

### Changed

- **AIAdjectiveNounPairs**, **CommitFileListing**,
  **CommitUnquantifiedClaims**: Promoted from `warning` to `error`, so the
  package's "all rules default to error" claim now holds across every
  style. `AIAdjectiveNounPairs` also gains `ignorecase` to match its
  sibling sequence rules.
- **OverusedVocabulary**: Reframed as the miscellaneous vocabulary bucket.
  Removed the nine words a more specific rule already owns (cornerstone,
  pivotal, nascent, testament, tapestry, multifaceted, intricate, seamless,
  transformative) so one span raises one alert; `nascent` now belongs to
  `GrowthMetaphors`. A header comment records the bucket principle. Inflected
  forms no sibling rule catches (the adverb, the plural) stay.
- **FormalRegister**: Add `ignorecase` so sentence-initial imperatives
  ("Utilize the helper.") no longer escape, and stop flagging `framework`
  and `methodology`, precise technical nouns the suggested swaps cannot
  replace.
- **FormalTransitions**: Anchor the pure-adverb tokens (Significantly,
  Fundamentally, Specifically, Essentially) to sentence-initial position
  so mid-sentence degree adverbs ("runs significantly faster") stay clean.
- **Cross-rule ownership**: Gave each shared phrase family one owner to end
  duplicate alerts. `UnpackExplore` owns "Let's explore/unpack/dive into"
  (dropped from `Metacommentary`); `StructureAnnouncements` owns "the
  takeaway is" (dropped from `Metacommentary` and `AffirmativeFormulas`);
  `HedgingPhrases` owns "it's worth noting/mentioning" (dropped from
  `Metacommentary`); `ContrastiveNegation` owns the two-item "no X, no Y"
  (dropped from `StackedAnaphora`, which keeps the three-plus shape);
  `MicDrop` owns pronoun one-liners like "It works." (excluded from
  `ParallelStaccato`); `ConclusionMarkers` owns "the bottom line is"
  (dropped from `AffirmativeFormulas`); `DefensiveHedges` owns the "to be
  honest, X, but Y" shape (narrowed in `FillerPhrases`).
- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Add "paying for itself" and "paying
  dividends" to the paying family, matching the fuller weight family.
- **FigurativeStrikes**, **FigurativeRides**: Extend the verb stems to the
  base forms ("strike a chord," "ride on this assumption"), which the
  inflected-only stems missed.
- **ParallelStaccato**: Fix the solo-verb token so "push" matches, not
  only "pushes."
- **VerbTricolon**: Add lowercase pronoun subjects so mid-sentence "they
  process X, validate Y, and format Z" is covered, matching the lowercase
  modal arm.
- **VocabularySwap** (experimental): Add the missing past-tense swap keys
  (facilitated, bolstered, elucidated, reimagined, encompassed, endeavored
  and endeavoured). The keys whose past tense doubles as a technical
  adjective (streamlined, elevated) stay omitted with a comment. The rule
  is now documented as an alternative to, not an addition on top of, the
  core vocabulary rules.

### Fixed

- **ConclusionMarkers**: Anchor the bare "Overall" and "Ultimately" to
  sentence-initial discourse-marker position so the ordinary adverb senses
  ("the overall design," "ultimately depends on") stay clean.
- **MicDrop**: Restrict the "Period." token to the standalone emphatic
  sentence so a noun ending ("billing period.") no longer fires.
- **StrategyBuzzwords**: Stop the "moat around" arm from matching the
  literal castle sense the file's own header promises stays clean.
- **FalseBalance**: Drop the "-dependent" compounds (context-dependent,
  situation-dependent), precise technical vocabulary with no evasive
  reading; the dodge "varies depending on" stays.
- **CommitTestEnumeration**: Require the comma-separated pass and fail pair
  so "retry 3 failed uploads" no longer trips the rule.
- **CommitMarketingAdjectives**: Drop "first-class" and "first class,"
  which match standard computer-science terminology.
- **CommitHedging**: Drop bare "seems to be," which fires on diagnostic
  prose ("the root cause seems to be a race condition").
- **Dead tokens**: Remove entries that never matched or duplicated a
  sibling: the duplicate "To put it another way" in `RestatementMarkers`,
  the duplicate emoji in `CommitEmoji`, and the shadowed "natural beauty
  of" and "an enduring legacy" in `PromotionalPuffery`.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-07-17

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **FigurativeLoud**: New rule. The mirror of FigurativeQuiet: "loud"
  for personified emphasis. A check that "fails loudly," a linter that
  "loudly complains," a metric that "sends a loud signal," a warning
  that comes through "loud and clear." Gated on the construction, so
  literal loudness (a room, music, a noise) and bare "out loud"
  (reading, thinking) never match.
- **FigurativeQuiet**: New rule. Flags "quiet" for personified
  inaction: a check that "stays quiet," a log that "goes quiet," a
  handler that "quietly drops" the error, "quietly ships," "quietly
  falls back." Gated on the construction (an inanimate subject going
  silent, or "quietly" ahead of an action verb), so literal quiet (a
  room, a person, the quiet flag) never matches. Named for the tell
  this package's own prose leaned on all session.
- **FigurativeWins**: New rule. Flags "wins" framing a choice as a
  contest: an approach that "wins the day," a design that "wins out," a
  refactor that is "a quick win," "a winning combination," "for the
  win." Complement-gated in the FigurativeSits mold, so the precedence
  sense ("last write wins," "the more specific rule wins") and literal
  winning (a team, a game) stay quiet.

### Changed

- **FigurativeCarries**: Add the content-possession shape, where an
  inanimate component is treated as a vessel that hauls abstract cargo
  rather than one that contains or transmits it ("the daemon carries no
  pipeline logic," "the packet carries the payload," "the signal
  carries data"). Gated on code-structure and transport nouns, so
  literal physical carrying and the phrasal "carries out" (execute)
  stay quiet. The message now names containment as well as consequence.
- **FigurativeRides**: Add the vehicle-exploitation shape, where an
  operation is dressed as a passenger on the infrastructure it merely
  uses ("the query rides the index," "the lookup rides the cache," "the
  scan rides the hot path"). Gated on a curated software-mechanism noun
  set, so a literal "rides the bus" stays quiet.
- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Add the reflexive-agency shape,
  where an operation performs a deliberate act on itself ("the query
  narrows itself," "the config tunes itself," "the rule set prunes
  itself"). Self-healing and self-correcting adjective forms stay quiet.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.24.0] - 2026-07-13

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **HollowAcknowledgment**: New rule. Flags the staged-insight
  antithesis that names a thing and then declines to act on it: "names
  the gap without filling it," "identifies the problem without solving
  it," "raises the question without answering it," plus the shorthand
  "all analysis, no action." Gated on a notice-verb, a "without"
  gerund, and a back-referring pronoun, so a plain "left without saying
  goodbye" stays quiet.
- **FigurativeStrikes**: New rule. Flags "strikes" for resonance and
  aptness: an argument that "strikes a chord," a critique that "strikes
  at the core of" the design, a phrase that "strikes the right tone,"
  "struck gold." Complement-gated in the FigurativeSits mold, so
  literal striking (a match, lightning, a labor strike) stays quiet;
  "strike a balance" remains in FalseBalance and "at the heart of"
  remains in PromotionalPuffery.
- **FigurativeLends**: New rule. Flags "lends" for conferring an
  abstract quality: a structure that "lends itself to" reuse, a study
  that "lends credence," a detail that "lends weight." Complement-gated,
  so literal lending (money, a book) stays quiet.
- **FigurativeDraws**: New rule. Flags "draws" for sourcing and
  comparison: an argument that "draws on" prior work, a section that
  "draws a distinction," a heading that "draws attention to" a caveat,
  a post that "draws to a close." Complement-gated, so literal drawing
  (a card, water, a weapon, blood) stays quiet.
- **FigurativeCasts**: New rule. Flags "casts" for projecting an
  abstraction: a finding that "casts doubt on" a result, a decision
  that "casts a long shadow," a rewrite that "casts a wide net."
  Complement-gated, so literal casting (a fishing line, metal, a vote,
  actors) stays quiet.
- **FigurativeFalls**: New rule. Flags "falls" for shortcoming,
  membership, and neglect: a result that "falls short," a design that
  "falls apart," a case that "falls under" a category or "falls within
  scope," a task that "falls by the wayside" or "through the cracks," a
  request that "falls on deaf ears," responsibility that "falls to" a
  team. Complement-gated in the FigurativeSits mold, so literal falling
  (prices, temperature, night, rain) stays quiet; disable the rule for
  gravity or weather writing. The past-tense "things fell into place"
  remains in NarrativePivots, and "falls into three categories" remains
  in CataphoricForecasting.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.23.0] - 2026-07-12

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **FigurativeHolds**: New rule. Flags "holds" as a possession verb for
  abstractions: a chart that "holds the same wide spread," a result
  that "holds across datasets," a claim that "holds up under
  scrutiny," an approach that "holds great promise," "the correlation
  still holds." Gated on the figurative complement or a curated
  abstract subject, so literal holding (hands, jars, court sessions)
  stays quiet; "holds its own" remains in AnthropomorphicJustification.
- **FigurativeRides**: New rule. Flags "rides" as a dependence and
  piggybacking verb ("everything rides on this migration," "the fix
  rides along with the release," "the cache rides on top of Redis,"
  "riding the wave of adoption"). Complement-gated in the
  FigurativeSits mold, so literal riding (buses, horses) stays quiet;
  disable the rule for transit or equestrian writing.
- **FigurativeCarries**: New rule. Flags "carries" as a freighting
  verb ("carries baggage," "carries significant risk," "carries a
  caveat," "carries the day," "one test carries the suite").
  Complement-gated, so literal carrying (bags, freight) stays quiet;
  "carries its weight" remains in AnthropomorphicJustification.
- **FigurativeRuns**: New rule. Flags "runs" on curated figurative
  complements only, since software literally runs everywhere: "runs
  deep," "runs counter to," "runs the gamut," "runs the risk of,"
  "ran its course," "running on fumes," "hit the ground running,"
  and the pervasion shape ("one limit runs under the whole table,"
  "a theme runs through the essay"). Literal senses ("run the
  tests," "the server runs on port 8080," "up and running") never
  match; "run a tight ship" remains in ShipOveruse.

### Changed

- **OrganicConsequence**: Add the effortless-emergence shape where a
  result "falls straight out of" its premise ("the design fell straight
  out of the constraints"). The manner adverb (straight, right,
  cleanly, directly, naturally) is the gate, so a literal "the pen fell
  out of my pocket" stays quiet.
- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Add "hinges on" alongside the
  existing "hangs on" arm ("the whole plan hinges on a single
  assumption," "hinges on whether"), gated on the same abstract
  complements so a literal door hinge stays quiet.
- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Add the adjudication family, where
  a fact gets the gavel: "availability settles the question," "the
  benchmark decides the debate," "latency puts the matter to rest,"
  "laid the issue to rest." Human settling ("we settled on a date,"
  "the team settled in") stays quiet.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.22.2] - 2026-07-12

<!-- vale off -->

### Fixed

- **CataphoricForecasting**: Fire on title-case headings. The bare
  cardinal-subject shape required lowercase words after the count, so
  "Three Layers Guard an EDA" as a heading stayed silent while its
  sentence-case twin fired. The words after the cardinal now allow
  capitals and the temporal lookahead matches case-insensitively, so
  "Two Weeks Notice" still stays clean. A cardinal-led proper noun
  ("Three Mile Island") now fires; add a project exception where
  those recur.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.22.1] - 2026-07-12

<!-- vale off -->

### Fixed

- **CommitFileListing**: Fire on the lists agents actually write. The
  per-line terminator required a newline after every bullet, but Vale
  hands raw text to the regex without a trailing newline on the last
  line, so a three-bullet list came up one repetition short and the
  rule never fired on its own test case. The terminator now accepts
  end-of-text, and the whitespace atoms no longer cross line
  boundaries. Paths wrapped in backticks or bold markers and paths
  with a trailing annotation ("src/app.ts: add handler") now count as
  file bullets too.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.22.0] - 2026-07-12

<!-- vale off -->

### Changed

- **ContrastiveFormulas**: Add the bare appositive contrast ("a
  refinement, not a rivalry"). The clause tokens all require a subject
  and a verb, so the verbless form slipped through in prose and never
  fired in headings. The new token needs no verb and fires in both
  places, and it subsumes the single-word-subject "X is a Y, not a Z"
  token, which is removed.
- **CataphoricForecasting**: Add bare cardinal-opener shapes with no
  curated noun or verb: the determiner-led count ("The three axes"),
  the sentence-initial count subject ("Eight repos seed the list"),
  and the folksy proportion ("three of every four runs," "nine times
  out of ten"). Temporal and partitive openers ("Three years ago,"
  "The two weeks of onboarding," "The three of us") stay clean via
  lookahead. A legitimate back-reference now fires ("The two functions
  return different types"); drop the count or add a project exception.
  The message now mentions measured figures as well as items.
- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Broaden the lexicon beyond the
  fixed idioms. New families: the bare grant with a curated object
  list ("earns a caveat," "earned the name"), coronation ("crowns the
  release," "crowning achievement"), rank-claiming gated on trophy
  objects ("claims the top spot," "stakes a claim") so a paper that
  claims a result stays clean, and agency verbs ("behaves itself,"
  "pretends otherwise," "cares deeply," "delivers on its promise,"
  "hangs on a single assumption," "hangs in the balance").
- **VerbTricolon**: Reword the message so it does not open with a
  spelled-out cardinal, which the broadened CataphoricForecasting now
  flags.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.21.2] - 2026-07-09

<!-- vale off -->

### Changed

- **HeadingTitleCase** (experimental): Exempt ordinal heading prefixes
  through the capitalization extension's `prefix` field. Labels such as
  "Section 1:", "Appendix A", and "Chapter IV" no longer read as Title
  Case, and neither do bare numeric ordinals ("1.1", "2."), with or
  without a trailing colon. The rule still checks the remainder of the
  heading, and the first word after the prefix still needs its capital
  letter. Recognized labels: Appendix, Chapter, Example, Figure, Part,
  Phase, Section, Stage, Step, and Table, each followed by a number, a
  single letter, or a roman numeral. The README now documents copying
  the rule into a project-owned style to change the prefix or the
  built-in exceptions, since `vale sync` overwrites packaged styles;
  word-level exceptions keep working through the project vocabulary.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.21.1] - 2026-07-07

<!-- vale off -->

### Changed

- **FigurativeLands**: Add a subordinator-gated arrival shape. A temporal
  or conditional subordinator ("once," "when," "whenever," "after,"
  "before," "until," "if," "as soon as"), a short subject, then the verb
  with no destination preposition ("once the feature lands," "when the PR
  lands," "until the fix lands"). The subordinator does the gating: the
  bare form floods, so only the subordinated form fires. The shared
  exceptions still apply, so a plane or a bird stays quiet.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.21.0] - 2026-07-01

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **FigurativeSits**: New rule. Flags "sits" used to place an abstraction
  rather than a physical object ("sits at the intersection of design and
  research," "sits alongside the incumbent," "the responsibility sits with
  the platform team," "the migration ticket just sits there"). The sibling
  of FigurativeLands, but the calculus flips: literal sitting is everywhere
  (people, pets, furniture, and buildings all sit), so the rule gates on the
  complement after the verb instead of the subject. Each token curates one
  figurative sense: conceptual placement ("sits at the core of"), spectrum
  range ("sits somewhere between"), an adverb plus a relational preposition
  ("sits squarely within scope"), companion or ranking pairing ("sits
  alongside," "sits atop," "sits astride"), the rests-with and within-scope
  idioms ("the decision sits with the board"), dormancy ("sits idle," "sits
  in isolation," "sits in limbo"), acceptance ("does not sit right"),
  emotional weight ("sits heavy"), opposition ("sits at odds with"), and
  noun-gated layer-stack and priority senses ("sits above the database
  tier," "sits at the top of the backlog"). Literal sitting ("the cat sits
  on the mat," "the cabin sits on the ridge") stays quiet; disable the rule
  for furniture, cartography, or page-layout writing. "At the heart of"
  stays with PromotionalPuffery to avoid a double flag.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.20.1] - 2026-06-30

<!-- vale off -->

### Changed

- **CataphoricForecasting**: Add a process-decomposition shape. A
  progression or split verb, a preposition, then a mid-sentence cardinal
  and a sequential-structure noun ("expands in three phases," "breaks
  down into four stages," "is split into three phases"). The count sits
  mid-sentence and lowercase, the shape the capitalized rules exclude on
  purpose; the verb and the sequential noun together gate out the
  ordinary count and the "three-tier" architecture reference. The noun
  set stays to phase-like scaffolding, so a literal split into physical
  parts or pieces does not fire.
- **CataphoricForecasting**: Add the categorization companion shape. Same
  grammar as the process-decomposition shape, with a grouping verb and a
  non-sequential grouping noun ("falls into three categories," "breaks
  down into four groups," "is sorted into two buckets"). The grouping
  noun set is disjoint from the sequential one, so the two shapes never
  fire on one clause.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.20.0] - 2026-06-30

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **CataphoricForecasting**: New rule. Flags the numbered lead-in that
  announces a count of items and then enumerates them ("Three pillars
  support this strategy," "Four user journeys define the experience,"
  "Here are the four options," "There are three reasons this matters").
  Three shapes: a capitalized cardinal plus a curated framework noun, a
  capitalized cardinal plus a noun phrase plus a forecasting verb, and the
  listicle pivot ("Here are the four ...," "The following five ...," a short
  cardinal-led clause ending in a colon). The tell is a lead-in, so the count
  is the sentence-initial subject; the capitalized cardinal excludes the
  ordinary mid-sentence number ("all three files," "about five minutes,"
  "the four corners of the map"). The forecasting-verb shape can fire on a
  literal count subject ("Four wheels drive the axle") and a few scaffold
  nouns carry literal senses ("Three levers control the press"); disable the
  rule for mechanical or hardware writing. Vale has no cross-block lookahead,
  so it cannot confirm the list that follows and leans on the sentence-initial
  position instead.

- **LabelAndExplain**: New rule. Flags the "noun-phrase label:
  explanatory sentence" construction ("The dominant attendee report:
  developers build from scratch because finding an existing extension
  is harder than writing a new one."). A determiner-led label of up to
  four lowercase words, a colon, then a lowercase clause of 20 or more
  characters ending in sentence punctuation. The lowercase clause leaves
  the capitalized "Label: Sentence" case to ColonUsage; the length
  requirement skips short values ("The output: green.") and dotted file
  lists; a lookbehind skips copula clause-labels ("The following options
  are available: ..."). A capitalized noun-phrase label needs
  part-of-speech tagging to catch and stays out of scope, because a
  Vale sequence cannot require a token after a skip gap.

### Changed

- **RhetoricalDevices**: The "The X:" dramatic-colon labels ("The catch:,"
  "The takeaway:," "The upshot:," and the rest) moved to LabelAndExplain,
  which now owns the "Label: sentence" construction. They still fire
  whatever follows the colon, so they keep catching the short and
  capitalized continuations the structural token skips. The question and
  test patterns ("Ask yourself:," "The test:") stay in RhetoricalDevices.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.19.0] - 2026-06-12

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **ColonUsage**: New rule. Replaces Google.Colons, which lints heading
  text too and flags the title half of "Appendix A: Glossary". The rule
  keeps the lowercase-after-colon check but exempts headings (ATX and
  setext) through a negated scope, and it skips acronyms, the pronoun
  "I", quotations, and clock times. Vale strips markup before matching,
  so a run-in bold label still flags; disable the rule where that
  convention is established.

### Changed

- The repository's own Vale config disables ColonUsage for its own docs
  and commit messages, which use the run-in bold label convention.

### Fixed

- Lint errors that predated this release in CLAUDE.md, TODO.md, and the
  doc-lint skill.
- The stale rule count in the CLAUDE.md project overview.
- The README now spells out "regular expressions" where it said "regex".

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-11

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **PassiveVoice** (experimental): New sequence rule. Flags passive
  constructions where the participle directly follows the auxiliary
  ("was eaten," "is called," "has been made"). The participle slot
  requires a past-participle tag from Vale's part-of-speech tagger, so
  predicate adjectives ("the results were mixed," "the talk was indeed
  useful," "the color is red") stay clean, unlike the regex rules in
  Google and write-good. Carries no exception list: conventional
  technical passives ("is deprecated," "is required") fire too, and
  users decide what to except.
- **PassiveVoiceAdverb** (experimental): New sequence rule. Companion
  for the adverb-gap shape ("was never used," "is automatically
  generated," "was not merged"), which the regex rules miss entirely
  because they allow only whitespace between the auxiliary and the
  participle.
- **PassiveDensity** (experimental): New Tengo rule. Flags a section
  when at least 3 sentences, and more than 35 percent of them, contain
  a passive construction. Occasional passive voice is ordinary English;
  sustained passive voice across a section is the fingerprint of AI
  formal register, and no per-instance rule can see it.

### Changed

- The repository's own Vale config disables Google.Passive,
  write-good.Passive, and write-good.E-Prime in favor of the new
  passive voice rules.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.17.1] - 2026-06-11

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **EmptyPaddingStacked**: New rule. A three-token companion to
  EmptyPadding that catches an empty modifier with an adjective ahead of
  the noun, such as "named operational support" or "certain strategic
  concerns." EmptyPadding stays on the bare modifier-noun pair; this rule
  covers the stacked shape, since Vale sequences cannot make the
  adjective slot optional.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-11

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **EmptyPadding**: New rule. Flags an empty modifier before a noun the
  noun does not need: "named stakeholders," "various stakeholders,"
  "respective roles," "given task," "certain constraints," "particular
  concerns." Sequence-based (modifier plus noun) and deliberately broad,
  so it also catches literal uses such as "named pipe," "various
  reasons," and "a certain amount." Suppress per-section where the
  literal sense is common.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-03

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **StrategyBuzzwords**: New rule. Flags strategy-deck buzzword
  metaphors: "growth flywheel," "competitive moat," "north star
  metric," "network effects," "first-mover advantage," "land grab."
  Each term is scoped to its figurative shape so the literal homograph
  stays clean (the engine's flywheel, a castle's moat, the real North
  Star). Network effects and first-mover advantage are the most
  legitimate as analytical terms and are the first to drop if they fire
  on genuine analysis.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-03

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **FigurativeAnchor** (experimental): New rule. Flags "anchor" used
  figuratively to ground an abstraction ("anchored in our values,"
  "anchor the strategy," "an emotional anchor," "serves as an anchor").
  Lives in the experimental package at `warning` because anchor is
  heavily homographic: the HTML anchor tag, a news anchor, a ship's
  anchor, an anchor tenant, and the anchoring bias are all literal and
  stay clean. Exemptions cover the physical objects something anchors to
  (a wall, the seabed); the rest leans on the figurative shape.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-02

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **FigurativeLands**: New rule. Flags "lands" used as an overused
  arrival verb ("the request lands on the node," "the PR lands in
  main," "where the idea lands") and exempts the common things that
  literally land (planes, spacecraft, birds, balls, snow, skydivers,
  territory nouns). The list is intentionally not exhaustive: rare
  landers fire, so aviation or nature writing disables the rule. Built
  on a broad match plus an exemption list because Vale's RE2 engine has
  no lookbehind, so the rule cannot scope by negative subject.
  Exemptions carry an inline
  case-insensitive flag because `ignorecase` covers tokens but not
  exemptions. Known limitation: the infinitive "to land on" fires
  (the matched subject is "to"), which suits the figurative sense but
  catches literal "to land on the runway."
- **ShipOveruse**: New rule. Flags "ship" as an AI overuse fingerprint:
  the release verb ("ship it," "ship fast," "ship the feature") and the
  maritime clichés ("run a tight ship," "the ship has sailed").
  Deliberately broad with no exemptions, so the logistics verb ("ship
  the order") and the vessel noun ("a cargo ship") are flagged too. Word
  boundaries keep the `-ship` suffixes (relationship, leadership) and
  compounds (spaceship, flagship) clean. Disable the whole rule for
  maritime or logistics prose.
- **ResonateOveruse**: New rule. Flags "resonate" as an overused
  reception verb ("resonates with audiences," "resonates deeply").
  Flagged broadly with no exemptions; the only literal sense is physics
  and acoustics, a clear domain that disables the whole rule. The noun
  forms "resonance" and "resonant" are a different word and stay clean.
- **SemicolonUsage**: New rule. Catches the semicolon used as an
  em-dash substitute: the punchy, comma-free, clause-final continuation
  an agent reaches for after the em-dash gets flagged. Following
  Google's guidance, it exempts the legitimate uses, which carry a comma
  (a series with internal punctuation, a "; however," join, a complex
  clause) or a conjunctive adverb. Several internal rule messages were
  reworded to drop their own semicolons.
- **GrowthMetaphors**: New rule. The startup-as-organism register:
  "incubate," "gestate," "nascent," "fledgling," "embryonic,"
  "cultivate," "nurture," and "in its infancy" are flagged broadly. The
  finance and tech-overloaded words are scoped to their startup phrases
  ("minimum viable," "seed funding," "organic growth") so the random
  seed, a viable option, and organic produce stay clean. Disable for
  medical or nature writing.
- **ContrastiveNegation**: New rule. Catches the telegraphic negation
  cadence agents reach for once "not X; it's Y" gets flagged: stacked
  "no setup, no config, no hassle" and the single clause-final fragment
  "cleartext repo names, no k-anonymity gate." Aggressive by design, so
  it also fires on a literal "coffee, no sugar"; disable it for terse
  spec lists. "No longer" and "no sooner" are exempt as temporal
  adverbs.

### Changed

- **ColloquialAssessments**: Drop the release-verb token ("lands in
  main") and the "lands at just the right" token, both now covered by
  FigurativeLands. The assessment sense ("the joke lands") stays.
- **OverusedVocabulary**: Add marketing and hype verbs (supercharge,
  unleash, turbocharge, democratize). The `-ed` forms of super and
  turbocharge are omitted so the literal "supercharged engine" stays
  clean.
- **Rule messages**: Standardize every diagnostic message to the
  `AI <label>: '%s'. <action>.` shape and add a RuleMessage view so the
  messages lint themselves (`just lint-messages`).

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.13.1] - 2026-05-28

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Add a "harm" family — `does harm`,
  `doing harm`, `does no harm`, `without doing harm`, `causes harm`,
  `causing harm`, and the `without causing harm` form. Treats
  inanimate subjects as moral agents capable of inflicting or
  withholding damage; technical prose rarely needs the Hippocratic
  register. Legitimate in medical / health-software writing, where
  the rule can be disabled per file via `.vale.ini`.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-28

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Extend the "paying" family with
  `pays its rent`, `paid its rent`, `paying its rent`. Same metaphor
  as `earns its keep` and `pays for itself` — treats inanimate
  subjects as tenants justifying their place.
- **ExplainerHeadings**: Add the `What It X` family alongside the
  `Why It X` shapes. Covers `What It Solves`, `What This Solves`,
  `What It Does`, `What This Does`. Same explanatory-throat-clearing
  register — the heading restates the section's job rather than
  doing it.

### Changed

- **StackedAnaphora**: Extend the 2- and 3-sentence indefinite-article
  exemplification stack patterns to accept `An` as well as `A`.
  Catches mixed pairs like `An unset X counts as Y. A set-but-wrong
  value belongs to Z.`
- **MicDrop**: Broaden the bare-`Not X.` one-word-verdict rule to
  also catch the bare `No X.` form (`No singleton.`, `No daemon.`,
  `No fallback.`, etc.). Replaced the v1.12.0 enumerated tail list
  with `Not? \w+\.` — accepts more conversational false positives
  (`No way.`, `Not bad.`) in exchange for full coverage of the
  AI register without maintaining a token list.
- **MicDrop**: Extend the verb-led contrastive family to non-linking
  verbs with noun objects. `They share a contract, not code.`,
  `Custom signals belong in stderr text, not in the exit number.`
  Covers `share`, `keep`, `hold`, `live`, `belong`, `sit`, `point`,
  `go`, `give`, `take` with optional prepositional heads
  (`in`, `on`, `to`, `at`, `with`, `for`).
- **MicDrop**: Catch the comparative aphorism mic-drop
  (`Disk costs less than lost context.`) — subject + verb +
  comparative adjective + `than` + object + period. Concise,
  sentence-final, in the AI tutorial-blog tone. Covers `more`,
  `less`, `fewer`, `faster`, `slower`, `cheaper`, `cleaner`,
  `simpler`, `safer`, `tighter`, `better`, `worse`, `larger`,
  `smaller`, `bigger`, `higher`, `lower`, `longer`, `shorter`.
- **ParallelStaccato**: Add multi-word-subject negation-parallel
  pairs — `Concurrent readers don't block each other. One writer
  at a time doesn't block readers.` Existing patterns only handled
  single-word subjects; this extends to 2-5 word noun phrases on
  both sides of the pair.
- **README**: Document the inline-code-stripping limitation. Vale
  strips inline-code content before applying regex rules, so AI
  tells whose subjects are wrapped in backticks (`` `session` ``,
  `` `PreToolUse` ``) silently slip past several `StackedAnaphora`
  patterns. Tested `scope: raw` against a 376-file corpus; gained
  14% more catches but also fired on repetition inside code blocks
  and on pattern-documentation. Not worth the FP cost.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-28

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Cover bare `does the work` /
  `doing the work`. Originally excluded as too prone to human-subject
  false positives, but in practice legitimate human uses tend to come
  with qualifiers (`the work of three people`), contrast (`does the
  work, gets no credit`), or relative clauses (`the team that does
  the work`). The bare construction with a non-human subject
  (`the CLI does the work`) is distinctive enough to flag.
- **MicDrop**: Extend the pronoun mic-drop family (`It matters.`,
  `This compounds.`) to explicit noun-phrase subjects. Covers
  `The/This/That [noun] matters.`, `compounds.`, `pays off.`,
  `adds up.` and the plural `These/Those [noun] matter.` family.
  Subjects allow up to three words and tolerate hyphens, so shapes
  like `The unset-versus-bogus distinction matters.` are caught.
- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Add a `deserves`/`deserve`
  family. Covers older idiomatic shapes (`deserves a closer look`,
  `deserves mention`, `deserves scrutiny`) and the gerund tell
  (`deserves noting`, `deserves exploring`, `deserves unpacking`,
  `deserves confirming`, `deserves revisiting`) that treats
  inanimate subjects as moral agents owed consideration.
- **RhetoricalDevices**: Add the dramatic-colon `The X:` family —
  terse noun-colon constructions where AI manufactures a drumroll
  instead of writing `The X is...`. Covers `The price:`,
  `The catch:`, `The kicker:`, `The upshot:`, `The tradeoff:`,
  `The trick:`, `The cost:`, `The downside:`, `The flip side:`,
  `The bottom line:`, `The takeaway:`, `The result:`,
  `The answer:`, `The reason:`, `The lesson:`, `The moral:`,
  `The point:`, `The pitch:`, `The fix:`, `The payoff:`.
- **AICompoundPhrases**: Add the `real` intensifier family for
  abstract nouns where AI inflates weight: `a real choice`,
  `a real option`, `a real difference`, `a real test`,
  `a real question`, `a real chance`, `a real problem`,
  `real value`, `real progress`, `real flexibility`,
  `real ownership`, `real accountability`, `real tradeoffs`,
  and similar. Enumerated rather than bare `real` to avoid
  `real-time`, `real estate`, `real world` collisions.
- **StackedAnaphora**: Add 3-sentence indefinite-article
  exemplification stacks — `A [noun] [verb]s ... A [noun] [verb]s
  ... A [noun] [verb]s ...` — the shape AI reaches for when
  enumerating hypothetical scenarios. The construction predates
  LLMs in API/concurrency reference docs but is now a sufficiently
  strong AI tell to flag uniformly.
- **StackedAnaphora**: Add the 2-sentence parallel-mirror variant
  of the same shape (`A session write lands in X. A subagent
  write lands in Y.`). The shared-verb framing carries the
  drumroll even with only two sentences.
- **ExplainerHeadings**: Add `Why It Exists` and `Why This Exists`
  alongside the existing `Why It Matters` / `Why This Matters`
  pair. Same explanatory-throat-clearing register.
- **MicDrop**: Catch the verb-led contrastive form that appears as
  a remediation cheat after the bare `X, not Y.` fragment gets
  flagged. Shape: `[Subject] [linking verb] [adjective], not
  [adjective].` Linking verbs include `stays`, `remains`,
  `becomes`, `feels`, `reads`, `seems`, `sounds`, `looks`,
  `appears`, `grows`, `ends up`, `comes across`. Example:
  `Isolation here stays logical, not physical.` Lives in MicDrop
  alongside the bare-fragment form so the same family triggers
  the same message.
- **StackedAnaphora**: Catch verbless definite-article noun-list
  fragments — `The X, the Y, the Z.` (3+ items, asyndetic or
  syndetic). Items may be up to 5 words to tolerate parenthetical
  glosses like `Time-To-Live (TTL)`. Requires sentence-initial
  capital `The` to reduce mid-sentence false positives on
  legitimate enumerations.
- **StackedAnaphora**: Catch the `Whether X, or whether Y.`
  subordinate-clause fragment — a `whether... or whether...`
  pair promoted to a standalone sentence with no main clause.
  Also catches the two-sentence variant
  `Whether X. Whether Y.` (anaphoric paired fragments).
- **MicDrop**: Extend the parallel noun-phrase fragment family
  to comparative adjectives — `Stronger isolation, more lifecycle
  machinery.`, `Faster delivery, fewer surprises.` Covers
  `Stronger`, `Weaker`, `Faster`, `Slower`, `Better`, `Worse`,
  `Cleaner`, `Simpler`, `Smaller`, `Larger`, `Bigger`, `Higher`,
  `Lower`, `Tighter`, `Looser`, `Smoother`, `Newer`, `Older`,
  `Richer`, `Leaner`, `Safer`, `Saner`, `More`, `Less`, `Fewer`.
- **MicDrop**: Catch the bare `Not X.` one-word-verdict fragment
  (`Not now.`, `Not yet.`, `Not necessarily.`, `Not magic.`,
  `Not optional.`, `Not random.`, `Not arbitrary.`, etc.).
  Enumerated tail to keep conversational `Not bad.` / `Not good.`
  responses from firing unless they sit in the tell register.
- **ServesAsDodge**: Catch the colon-cheat copula-replacement —
  `The candidate mechanism: a hook on Bash that...` where AI has
  swapped `is` or `are` for a colon to dodge weak-verb or
  passive-voice lints. Same anti-`is` evasion as the
  `serves as a` / `stands as the` patterns, just performed with
  punctuation. Triggered by a 4+ word definite-NP subject,
  indefinite article after the colon, and 6+ token descriptive
  content so short pedagogical `X is: Y` answers stay quiet.
- **AICompoundPhrases**: Add the investigation-thread family
  (`threads to pull on`, `thread to pull on`, `loose threads
  to pull`, `loose threads to chase`, `another thread to pull`,
  etc.) and the solidification-metaphor family
  (`before/after [X] hardens` / `hardened` / `solidifies` /
  `solidified` / `ossifies` / `ossified`). Both are AI
  tutorial-blog vocabulary that recurs in design docs and
  pre-release write-ups.

### Changed

- **README**: Document three structural patterns Vale can't
  reliably flag — noun-phrase + past-participle fragments
  (`The same set, applied identically by every client...`),
  adjective-led fragments without an explicit subject
  (`Durable enough for coordination state, without...`), and
  headless-infinitive section openers
  (`Threads to pull on in X before Y hardens.`). All three
  need syntactic parsing beyond regex token matching. Some
  characteristic vocabulary of the third shape now fires via
  `AICompoundPhrases`, but the structure itself stays beyond
  reach.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-27

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **RedundantPrecaution**: New rule for a redundant-precaution idiom
  that has graduated to AI-cliché status in public discourse. Narrow
  scope by design — covers the flagship spaced form (`belt and
  suspenders`) and its hyphenated adjectival form
  (`belt-and-suspenders`). Neighboring patterns in the same register
  (`for good measure`, `out of an abundance of caution`, `cover all
  the bases`, `just to be safe`) were intentionally omitted; they may
  land in a follow-up if the cluster proves coherent.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-26

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **WrapUpHeadings**: New heading-scoped rule for closing-flourish
  headings that summarize what the section already said. Covers
  `Final Thoughts`, `Closing Thoughts`, `Parting Thoughts`, `Wrapping
  Up`, `Wrap-Up`, `Wrap Up`, `Putting It All Together`, `Bringing It
  All Together`, `Tying It All Together`, `The Big Picture`, `The
  Bottom Line`, `The Takeaway`, `Final Word`, `Last Word`, and `Final
  Take`. Conventional one-word headings like `Conclusion`, `Summary`,
  and `Overview` were intentionally omitted to avoid false positives
  on standard documentation structure.
- **ExplainerHeadings**: New heading-scoped rule for tutorial-blog
  heading clichés. Covers `Deep Dive`, `Under the Hood`, `Demystifying`,
  `Why It Matters`, `Why This Matters`, `A Closer Look`, and `The
  Inner Workings`. The `X 101` pattern was considered but omitted
  because Go RE2 lacks the lookahead needed to exclude legitimate uses
  like `Highway 101` or `Route 101`.
- **MarketingHeadings**: New heading-scoped rule for promotional-
  register headings. Covers `The Ultimate Guide`, `Everything You
  Need to Know`, `Mastering`, `Unlocking`, `The Power of`, `The
  Magic of`, `Why Choose`, `The Future of`, `The Art of`, `The
  Science of`, `A Game-Changer`, and `Revolutionizing`. `Transforming`
  was considered but omitted as too operational (`Transforming Data
  with X` is a legitimate heading shape).
- **AnnouncementHeadings**: New heading-scoped rule for headings that
  narrate content delivery instead of delivering it. Covers `What
  You'll Learn` / `What You Will Learn`, `What We'll Cover` / `What
  We Will Cover`, `What to Expect`, `What We're Building` / `What We
  Are Building`, and `Here's What You'll Get` / `Here's What You Get`.
  Navigation-style sections like `What's Next` and `Next Steps` were
  intentionally omitted because they serve a real navigation purpose
  in READMEs.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-20

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **ColloquialAssessments**: New rule for knowing-tone verdicts that
  surface as recurring AI tells in casual technical writing. Covers
  figurative landing of jokes, points, and analogies (anchored to a
  narrow noun list plus `really lands` and `actually lands`); anchored
  move-as-verdict shapes like `is the move`, `that's the move`, `the
  right move`, and `the play here`; and rhetorical wind-ups about what
  counts most (`what really matters`, `all that matters`, `the only
  thing that truly matters`). Chess analysis where `Nf3 is the move`
  is the natural phrasing is documented as a known per-section
  limitation.

### Changed

- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: Extended to cover structural-
  importance descriptors (`load-bearing`, `load bearing`) and a
  qualified work-doing family (`does the real work`, `doing the
  important work`, `does most of the work`, and so on). Bare work-doing
  patterns without the qualifier were intentionally omitted to avoid
  matching legitimate human-subject sentences such as "engineers do the
  work."
- **AICompoundPhrases**: Extended with needle-moving variants (`move`,
  `moves`, `moved`, `moving the needle`, plus `nudge the needle`
  forms) and capability-unlocking shapes (`unlocks new`, `unlocks the
  potential`, `unlocks the power`, `unlocks the value`, `unlocks
  capabilities`, `unlocks possibilities`).
- **NarrativePivots**: Extended with industry-altering rhetoric
  (`changed the game` and `changed the landscape` variants),
  rule-overhauling (`rewrote the rules`, `rewrote the playbook`), and
  script-flipping (`flipped the script`, `moved the goalposts`,
  `shifted the paradigm`).
- **OverusedVocabulary**: Added the sincerity adjective and adverb
  (`genuine`, `genuinely`).
- **FillerPhrases**: Extended the performative-sincerity section with
  honesty-preamble hedges (`I'll be honest`, `to be perfectly honest`,
  `to be completely honest`, `to be totally honest`, `to be brutally
  honest`, `the honest truth`, `my honest take`, `honest answer`, and
  related forms).
- **VocabularySwap** (experimental, warning level): Added
  substitution suggestions for the sincerity adverb (`genuinely` to
  `really` or `truly`), the sincerity adjective (`genuine` to `real`,
  `authentic`, or `true`), and the figurative-enabling verb (`unlock`,
  `unlocks`, `unlocked`, `unlocking` to `enable` variants or `make
  possible`).

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-13

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **StackedAnaphora**: Extended to cover adverb anchors — always, never,
  fully, completely, entirely, truly, purely, only, and just. Each adverb
  gets a period-separated variant (two parallel sentences sharing the lead
  adverb) and a comma-separated variant (two parallel clauses sharing the
  lead adverb). The comma variant accepts a lowercase second clause so
  colon-led shapes also match.

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-11

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

Seven new rules in the `ai-tells-commits` style, bringing the total to 13.

- **CommitTestEnumeration**: Flags scoreboard-style test reporting in commit
  messages such as enumerated pass and fail counts, percentage coverage
  figures, and the catch-all phrases about every test passing or being green.
  Commits should link the CI run instead of restating raw numbers.
- **CommitAttribution**: Flags agent marketing trailers including robot-emoji
  "Generated with" banners, "Co-Authored-By" lines naming Claude, Copilot, or
  Cursor, and the Anthropic noreply email signature. Kernel-style
  `Assisted-by: AGENT:VERSION` trailers remain allowed.
- **CommitPastTense**: Flags past-tense and present-participle verbs on the
  subject line ("Added X," "Fixed Y," "Refactoring Z"). Uses `\A` with
  `scope: raw` so body paragraphs that happen to start with one of these
  verbs are not flagged.
- **CommitChangelogStyle**: Flags Keep-a-Changelog headings inside a single
  commit body (`## Added`, `### Fixed`, `### Breaking Changes`, etc.).
  CHANGELOG.md is the place for that format; commit bodies should explain
  in prose what changed and why.
- **CommitMarketingAdjectives**: Flags marketing intensifiers in commit
  messages ("production-ready," "enterprise-grade," "mission-critical,"
  "battle-tested," "bulletproof"). Four hyphenated tokens already covered
  by `OverusedVocabulary` and `AICompoundPhrases` are intentionally omitted.
- **CommitUnquantifiedClaims** (warning): Flags performance, size, and speed
  claims used without numbers ("significantly faster," "much smaller,"
  "blazingly fast"). Ships at warning rather than error so legitimate
  commits with obvious gains are not blocked.
- **CommitFileListing** (warning): Flags commit bodies that enumerate three
  or more consecutive bullets which look like file paths. The diff already
  shows which files changed; the body should describe what changed about
  the code.

<!-- vale on -->

### Fixed

- **Lint**: Cleaned up pre-existing `Vale.Spelling` and `Google.Semicolons`
  noise by extending the project vocabulary with legitimate technical terms
  and author names, suppressing the leaked `Google.Semicolons` override on
  synced style packages via the `styles/**` section of `.vale.ini`, and
  reworking one paragraph in `EXPERIMENTAL.md` so it stops tripping the
  experimental sentence-length-variance rule.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-03-25

<!-- vale off -->

### Added

- **AnthropomorphicJustification**: New rule for treating abstractions like
  employees under performance review: "earns its keep," "does the heavy
  lifting," "pulls its weight," "pays for itself," "speaks for itself," etc.
- **ParallelStaccato**: New rule for back-to-back minimal sentences with
  parallel structure ("Engineers build. Managers ship.") and solo two-word
  staccato sentences ("Complexity scales.").
- **MicDropHeadings**: New rule (scoped to headings) for tagline-style headings:
  "Clarity, not cleverness," "Simple, then fast," "Speed over correctness,"
  "X first, Y second," etc.

### Changed

- **ContrastiveFormulas**: Added plural subject negation-correction patterns
  ("These aren't X. They're Y."), "doesn't mean X / it means Y" patterns, and
  multi-word subject patterns ("The colophon isn't a disclaimer. It's a
  feature.") that the existing single-word subject rules didn't cover.
- **MicDrop**: Added contrastive fragments ("Dense, not cramped."), preference
  fragments ("Clarity over cleverness."), sequencing fragments ("Scannable,
  then readable."), imperative mic-drops ("Trust the process."), categorical
  declarations ("Density is a feature."), and colon-tagged tagline glosses
  (": the reference shelf, not the opinion column.").

<!-- vale on -->

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Vocabulary**: Renamed project vocabulary from `ai-tells` to `vale-ai-tells`
  to avoid confusion with the style package, and excluded it from release zips
  since it's a project-local spelling allowlist, not something consumers need.
- **Tengo scripts**: Strip HTML comments from prose analysis so vale
  suppression directives (`<!-- vale ... -->`) are not treated as content.
  Also filter list items and table rows from SentenceStartRepetition to
  prevent structured lists from triggering false positives.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Packaging**: `ai-tells-experimental.zip` now uses Vale's nested package
  structure (`ai-tells-experimental/styles/...`) so that `vale sync` correctly
  installs both rules and Tengo scripts. The old zip had `config/scripts/` as a
  sibling directory, and Vale's package sync silently dropped it.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

<!-- vale off -->
- **ai-tells-experimental**: New opt-in style with 13 rules for detecting
  structural AI writing patterns beyond Vale's regular expression rules.
  Uses Tengo scripts, metric formulas, capitalization, and substitution
  check types to analyze document-level properties. Shipped as a separate
  `ai-tells-experimental.zip` release artifact (includes `config/scripts/`).
  All rules at `warning` level; thresholds are research-grounded starting
  points pending calibration on a larger corpus.
- **SentenceLengthVariance** (script): Flags sections where the coefficient
  of variation of sentence word counts falls below 0.30. Gibbs (2024):
  ChatGPT averages ~27 words/sentence with low variance; PNAS (2025):
  instruction-tuned LLMs compress the sentence-length range humans produce
- **ParagraphLengthVariance** (script): Flags sections where paragraph-length
  CV falls below 0.25. Pangram Labs (2025): AI paragraphs default to uniform
  60-100 word blocks
- **SentenceStartRepetition** (script): Flags sections where >30% of
  sentences start with the same word (at least 6 sentences, 3 occurrences).
  Complements `StackedAnaphora` for non-consecutive repetition
- **SentenceStartEntropy** (script): Measures Shannon entropy of sentence-
  starting words per section. Flags when normalized entropy falls below 0.65,
  catching low diversity even when no single opener dominates
- **ContentDuplication** (script): Detects near-identical paragraphs within
  a section using Jaccard word-overlap similarity. Flags the later occurrence
  when two paragraphs share more than 60% of their words
- **ContractionAvoidance** (script): Detects documents that avoid
  contractions despite using informal language. Two-pass approach: informality
  gate (pronouns, questions) then ratio check. PNAS (2025): GPT models use
  contractions at 60-63% of the human rate
- **TransitionRepetition** (script): Flags when the same formal transition
  phrase appears 3+ times within a section. Tracks 20 common transitions
  including "moreover," "furthermore," "additionally," "hence," "thus"
- **TricolonDensityDocument** (script): Detects when tricolons make up >60%
  of all enumerated lists in a document with at least 4 tricolons and 20%
  sentence density. Gorrie (2024), tropes.fyi: tricolon overuse is a key AI
  rhetorical tell
- **AverageSentenceLength** (metric): Flags documents where
  `words / sentences > 25.0`
- **LongWordDensity** (metric): Flags documents where
  `long_words / words > 0.4`. PNAS (2025): mean word length ranks as a top-5
  discriminating feature between AI and human text
- **ComplexWordDensity** (metric): Flags documents where
  `complex_words / words > 0.3`. PNAS (2025): nominalizations appear at
  150-214% of human rates in GPT output
- **HeadingTitleCase** (capitalization): Flags markdown headings using Title
  Case. Wikipedia: "AI chatbots strongly tend to capitalize all main words
  in section headings." Supports project-specific exceptions via Vale vocab
- **VocabularySwap** (substitution): Inline rewrite suggestions for 20 AI
  vocabulary words (56 swap entries covering inflected forms). Complements
  `OverusedVocabulary` by suggesting concrete alternatives
<!-- vale on -->

### Changed

<!-- vale ai-tells.ShipOveruse = NO -->
- **Release workflow**: `ai-tells-experimental.zip` now ships as its own
  release artifact alongside `ai-tells.zip` and `ai-tells-commits.zip`
<!-- vale ai-tells.ShipOveruse = YES -->

### Fixed

- **SentenceStartRepetition**: Fixed integer division that caused the rule
  to fire only at 100% repetition instead of the intended 30% threshold
- **ContractionAvoidance**: Fixed integer division that caused false
  positives on every document with full forms regardless of contraction count.

  Added 9 missing contraction/full-form pairs (you'll, you've, she's, he's,
  there's, here's, what's, who's, let's)
<!-- vale write-good.E-Prime = YES -->
<!-- vale Google.We = YES -->
<!-- vale ai-tells.FormalTransitions = NO -->
<!-- vale Google.Quotes = NO -->
- **TransitionRepetition**: Fixed substring matching that counted "thus"
  inside "enthusiasm" and "hence" inside "whence". Now uses word-boundary
  matching
<!-- vale ai-tells.FormalTransitions = YES -->
<!-- vale Google.Quotes = YES -->
- **SentenceLengthVariance**, **SentenceStartRepetition**: Fixed section
  variable overwriting that broke position lookups (all matches pointed to
  position 0)
- **ParagraphLengthVariance**: Fixed code-block toggle tracking that got
  permanently stuck, skipping all content after the first fenced block.
  Now strips code blocks via pattern matching before paragraph splitting
- **Script rule messages**: Removed `%s` placeholders from 4 script rule
  messages that dumped the entire matched text span instead of metric values
- **Section splitting**: All 7 section-splitting scripts now handle headings
  at the start of a document; earlier versions needed a leading newline

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

<!-- vale ai-tells.ShipOveruse = NO -->
- **Packaging**: `ai-tells-commits` now ships as its own zip asset,
  `ai-tells-commits.zip`, so Vale can install it as a separate package.
  Before, it shipped inside `ai-tells.zip`, which Vale ignored during
  sync because the directory name didn't match the package name.
<!-- vale ai-tells.ShipOveruse = YES -->

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

<!-- vale off -->

- **VerbTricolon**: New rule detecting exactly-three parallel verb lists
  ("build, test, and deploy"), covering gerund, past tense, third person, modal,
  infinitive, colon-introduced, asyndetic, and subject-verb tricolon forms
- **VerbTricolonDensity**: New occurrence-based rule flagging paragraphs with
  two or more verb tricolons
- **MicDrop**: New rule catching short dramatic sentences used for manufactured
  emphasis in technical prose ("It matters." "Full stop." "And it shows.")
- **ServesAsDodge**: New rule detecting inflated copula replacements where AI
  substitutes "serves as a," "stands as the," "represents a pivotal," or
  "boasts a vibrant" for simple "is" or "are." Backed by PNAS data showing a
  10%+ decrease in is/are usage in AI text
- **ParticipialPadding**: New rule catching present participle (-ing) phrases
  appended for shallow analysis ("highlighting its importance," "reflecting
  broader trends," "solidifying its position"). The #1 discriminating feature
  in the PNAS study (GPT-4o uses participial clauses at 527% of the human rate)
- **VagueAttributions**: New rule flagging claims attributed to unnamed
  authorities ("experts argue," "studies show that," "research suggests,"
  "a growing body of evidence")
- **DespiteChallenges**: New rule catching the rigid "despite challenges"
  dismissal formula where AI acknowledges problems only to immediately dismiss
  them with optimism ("despite these challenges," "while challenges remain,"
  "challenges notwithstanding")
- **RhetoricalSelfAnswer**: New rule detecting self-posed rhetorical questions
  answered for dramatic effect ("The result/catch/worst part?" followed by an
  immediate answer)
- **SequencingMarkers**: New rule flagging formulaic ordinal sequencing that
  disguises a list as prose ("Firstly," "Secondly," "The first takeaway,"
  "The second benefit")
- **FalseExclusivity**: New rule catching false insider drama that claims
  something is secret or unspoken ("nobody talks about," "the dirty secret,"
  "what most people miss," "the elephant in the room")
- **NarrativePivots**: New rule detecting unearned dramatic pivot phrases
  ("something shifted," "everything changed," "that changed everything,"
  "it was a wake-up call," "the penny dropped")
- **PromotionalPuffery**: New rule flagging promotional and travel-brochure
  language ("nestled in," "vibrant community," "a beacon of," "renowned for
  its," "has emerged as a," "left an indelible mark")

<!-- vale on -->

<!-- vale off -->
- **ai-tells-commits**: New opt-in style with 6 rules purpose-built for
  detecting AI tells in commit messages and PR descriptions. Shipped in the
  same release zip as `ai-tells` but in a separate `ai-tells-commits` directory
  so users can enable it independently via `BasedOnStyles = ai-tells-commits`.
  Rules based on research including "Fingerprinting AI Coding Agents on GitHub"
  (arXiv:2601.17406), the Allstacks Emoji Commit Index, and community analysis
  of output from Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Aider, and Windsurf.
- **CommitSelfReference**: Flags self-narrating preambles: "This commit adds,"
  "This PR introduces," "In this change," "These changes ensure," etc.
- **CommitTrailingJustification**: Flags trailing clauses that restate the
  obvious: "ensuring consistency," "improving readability," "which allows for,"
  "for better maintainability," etc.
- **CommitBuzzwords**: Flags vague adjective+noun combos characteristic of AI
  commits: "comprehensive tests," "robust error handling," "proper validation,"
  "various fixes," "relevant components," "necessary changes," etc.
- **CommitHedging**: Flags inappropriate uncertainty for changes already made:
  "This should fix," "This may help," "seems to resolve," etc.
- **CommitEmoji**: Flags systematic gitmoji prefixes. Emoji commit adoption
  jumped from ~25% to ~75% of organizations in 2023–2025, driven almost
  entirely by AI commit tools.
- **CommitOverexplanation**: Flags commit-specific filler: "As part of this
  change," "The purpose of this commit," "Summary of changes," "The following
  changes were made," etc.
<!-- vale on -->

  commit message AI tells

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

<!-- vale off -->

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

<!-- vale off -->
- **OverusedVocabularyVerbs**: New sequence-based rule constraining AI vocabulary
  tokens (leverage, navigate, showcase, harness, embark, foster, spearhead) to
  verb uses only — "financial leverage" and "climbing harness" no longer trigger
<!-- vale on -->
- **AIAdjectiveNounPairs**: New sequence-based rule catching AI-characteristic
  adjectives immediately preceding any noun. Currently at `warning` level pending
  false positive calibration on real prose. Promotion to `error` follows once

### Added

<!-- vale off -->
- **Commit-message linting**: Vale now runs on `COMMIT_EDITMSG` via a
  `commit-msg` pre-commit hook, catching AI-generated patterns before they land
  in history. The hook applies only `ai-tells` rules (not Google/write-good/
  proselint) to keep noise low. See README for setup instructions.
- **Justfile**: Task runner with recipes for linting (`lint`, `lint-yaml`,
  `lint-prose`, `lint-markdown`, `lint-spelling`), Vale style syncing (`sync`),
  and pre-commit hook management (`prek`, `prek-all`, `prek-install`)
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Pre-commit hooks for YAML validation
  (yamllint), spelling (codespell), Markdown linting (rumdl), and prose
  linting (vale), plus standard file hygiene hooks
- **`.yamllint.yaml`**: yamllint configuration extending default rules with
  `line-length` turned off (Vale rule files contain arbitrarily long regular expression tokens)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Development workflow instructions for first-time setup,
  running linters, and using pre-commit hooks
- **ClosingPleasantries**: New rule catching AI sign-off language — "I hope
  this helps," "Feel free to ask," "Don't hesitate to reach out," "Happy to
  help," "Best of luck," and similar pleasantries that appear at the end of
  AI-generated responses
- **RestatementMarkers**: New rule flagging redundant restatements — "In other
  words," "Simply put," "To be more specific," "What I mean is," etc.
- **SelfReference**: New rule detecting self-referential cross-references —
  "as mentioned above," "as noted earlier," "as we'll explore," "recall that," etc.
<!-- vale on -->
